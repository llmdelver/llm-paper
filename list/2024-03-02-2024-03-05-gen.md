## Bespoke Non-Stationary Solvers for Fast Sampling of Diffusion and Flow   Models 
  * 2024-03-02  
  * This paper introduces Bespoke Non-Stationary (BNS) Solvers, a solver distillation approach to improve sample efficiency of Diffusion and Flow models. BNS solvers are based on a family of non-stationary solvers that provably subsumes existing numerical ODE solvers and consequently demonstrate considerable improvement in sample approximation (PSNR) over these baselines. Compared to model distillation, BNS solvers benefit from a tiny parameter space ($<$200 parameters), fast optimization (two orders of magnitude faster), maintain diversity of samples, and in contrast to previous solver distillation approaches nearly close the gap from standard distillation methods such as Progressive Distillation in the low-medium NFE regime. For example, BNS solver achieves 45 PSNR / 1.76 FID using 16 NFE in class-conditional ImageNet-64. We experimented with BNS solvers for conditional image generation, text-to-image generation, and text-2-audio generation showing significant improvement in sample approximation (PSNR) in all.

## SceneCraft: An LLM Agent for Synthesizing 3D Scene as Blender Code 
  * 2024-03-02  
  * This paper introduces SceneCraft, a Large Language Model (LLM) Agent converting text descriptions into Blender-executable Python scripts which render complex scenes with up to a hundred 3D assets. This process requires complex spatial planning and arrangement. We tackle these challenges through a combination of advanced abstraction, strategic planning, and library learning. SceneCraft first models a scene graph as a blueprint, detailing the spatial relationships among assets in the scene. SceneCraft then writes Python scripts based on this graph, translating relationships into numerical constraints for asset layout. Next, SceneCraft leverages the perceptual strengths of vision-language foundation models like GPT-V to analyze rendered images and iteratively refine the scene. On top of this process, SceneCraft features a library learning mechanism that compiles common script functions into a reusable library, facilitating continuous self-improvement without expensive LLM parameter tuning. Our evaluation demonstrates that SceneCraft surpasses existing LLM-based agents in rendering complex scenes, as shown by its adherence to constraints and favorable human assessments. We also showcase the broader application potential of SceneCraft by reconstructing detailed 3D scenes from the Sintel movie and guiding a video generative model with generated scenes as intermediary control signal.

## TCIG: Two-Stage Controlled Image Generation with Quality Enhancement   through Diffusion 
  * 2024-03-02  
  * In recent years, significant progress has been made in the development of text- to-image generation models. However, these models still face limitations when it comes to achieving full controllability during the generation process. Often, spe- cific training or the use of limited models is required, and even then, they have certain restrictions. To address these challenges, A two-stage method that effec- tively combines controllability and high quality in the generation of images is proposed. This approach leverages the expertise of pre-trained models to achieve precise control over the generated images, while also harnessing the power of diffusion models to achieve state-of-the-art quality. By separating controllability from high quality, This method achieves outstanding results. It is compatible with both latent and image space diffusion models, ensuring versatility and flexibil- ity. Moreover, This approach consistently produces comparable outcomes to the current state-of-the-art methods in the field. Overall, This proposed method rep- resents a significant advancement in text-to-image generation, enabling improved controllability without compromising on the quality of the generated images.

## Text-guided Explorable Image Super-resolution 
  * 2024-03-02  
  * In this paper, we introduce the problem of zero-shot text-guided exploration of the solutions to open-domain image super-resolution. Our goal is to allow users to explore diverse, semantically accurate reconstructions that preserve data consistency with the low-resolution inputs for different large downsampling factors without explicitly training for these specific degradations. We propose two approaches for zero-shot text-guided super-resolution - i) modifying the generative process of text-to-image \textit{T2I} diffusion models to promote consistency with low-resolution inputs, and ii) incorporating language guidance into zero-shot diffusion-based restoration methods. We show that the proposed approaches result in diverse solutions that match the semantic meaning provided by the text prompt while preserving data consistency with the degraded inputs. We evaluate the proposed baselines for the task of extreme super-resolution and demonstrate advantages in terms of restoration quality, diversity, and explorability of solutions.

## Face Swap via Diffusion Model 
  * 2024-03-02  
  * This technical report presents a diffusion model based framework for face swapping between two portrait images. The basic framework consists of three components, i.e., IP-Adapter, ControlNet, and Stable Diffusion's inpainting pipeline, for face feature encoding, multi-conditional generation, and face inpainting respectively. Besides, I introduce facial guidance optimization and CodeFormer based blending to further improve the generation quality.   Specifically, we engage a recent light-weighted customization method (i.e., DreamBooth-LoRA), to guarantee the identity consistency by 1) using a rare identifier "sks" to represent the source identity, and 2) injecting the image features of source portrait into each cross-attention layer like the text features. Then I resort to the strong inpainting ability of Stable Diffusion, and utilize canny image and face detection annotation of the target portrait as the conditions, to guide ContorlNet's generation and align source portrait with the target portrait. To further correct face alignment, we add the facial guidance loss to optimize the text embedding during the sample generation.

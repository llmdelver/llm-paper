## LM4OPT: Unveiling the Potential of Large Language Models in Formulating   Mathematical Optimization Problems 
  * 2024-03-02  
  * In the rapidly evolving field of natural language processing, the translation of linguistic descriptions into mathematical formulation of optimization problems presents a formidable challenge, demanding intricate understanding and processing capabilities from Large Language Models (LLMs). This study compares prominent LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama-2-7b, in zero-shot and one-shot settings for this task. Our findings show GPT-4's superior performance, particularly in the one-shot scenario. A central part of this research is the introduction of `LM4OPT,' a progressive fine-tuning framework for Llama-2-7b that utilizes noisy embeddings and specialized datasets. However, this research highlights a notable gap in the contextual understanding capabilities of smaller models such as Llama-2-7b compared to larger counterparts, especially in processing lengthy and complex input contexts. Our empirical investigation, utilizing the NL4Opt dataset, unveils that GPT-4 surpasses the baseline performance established by previous research, achieving an F1-score of 0.63, solely based on the problem description in natural language, and without relying on any additional named entity information. GPT-3.5 follows closely, both outperforming the fine-tuned Llama-2-7b. These findings not only benchmark the current capabilities of LLMs in a novel application area but also lay the groundwork for future improvements in mathematical formulation of optimization problems from natural language input.

## Chaining thoughts and LLMs to learn DNA structural biophysics 
  * 2024-03-02  
  * The future development of an AI scientist, a tool that is capable of integrating a variety of experimental data and generating testable hypotheses, holds immense potential. So far, bespoke machine learning models have been created to specialize in singular scientific tasks, but otherwise lack the flexibility of a general purpose model. Here, we show that a general purpose large language model, chatGPT 3.5-turbo, can be fine-tuned to learn the structural biophysics of DNA. We find that both fine-tuning models to return chain-of-thought responses and chaining together models fine-tuned for subtasks have an enhanced ability to analyze and design DNA sequences and their structures.

## VBART: The Turkish LLM 
  * 2024-03-02  
  * We present VBART, the first Turkish sequence-to-sequence Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on a large corpus from scratch. VBART are compact LLMs based on good ideas leveraged from BART and mBART models and come in two sizes, Large and XLarge. Fine-tuned VBART models surpass the prior state-of-the-art results in abstractive text summarization, title generation, text paraphrasing, question answering and question generation tasks. They allow fine-tuning for future text generation tasks and datasets, carving a new path for Turkish Natural Language Processing (NLP) research. Our work shows that having a pre-trained LLM for Turkish outperforms up to 3x multilingual models, improving existing results and providing efficient models for training and inference. Moreover, we show that our monolingual tokenizer is 7x more efficient than OpenAI's multilingual tokenizer. Last but not least, we introduce a method to enlarge an existing pre-trained LLM and question the relevancy of Chinchilla Scaling Law to sequence-to-sequence masked language models. Our fine-tuned models, tokenizer and cleaned web corpus of 135 GB are publicly available at huggingface.co/vngrs-ai.

## Improving the Validity of Automatically Generated Feedback via   Reinforcement Learning 
  * 2024-03-02  
  * Automatically generating feedback via large language models (LLMs) in intelligent tutoring systems and online learning platforms has the potential to improve the learning outcomes of many students. However, both feedback generation and evaluation are challenging: feedback content has to be valid especially in subjects like math, which requires models to understand the problem, the solution, and where the student's error lies. Feedback also has to be pedagogically valid to reflect effective tutoring strategies, such as explaining possible misconceptions and encouraging the student, among other desirable features. In this work, we address both problems of automatically generating and evaluating feedback while considering both correctness and alignment. First, we propose a rubric for evaluating math feedback and show that GPT-4 is able to effectively use it to annotate human-written and LLM-generated feedback. Second, we propose a framework for feedback generation that optimizes both correctness and alignment using reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we use GPT-4's annotations to create preferences over feedback pairs in an augmented dataset for training via direct preference optimization (DPO). We show that our methods significantly increase the correctness and alignment of generated feedback with Llama 2, an open-source LLM, qualitatively analyze our generation and evaluation systems using case studies, and outline several areas for future work.

## NoMAD-Attention: Efficient LLM Inference on CPUs Through   Multiply-add-free Attention 
  * 2024-03-02  
  * Large language model inference on Central Processing Units (CPU) is challenging due to the vast quantities of expensive Multiply-Add (MAD) matrix operations in the attention computations. In this paper, we argue that there is a rare gem in modern CPUs, Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data (SIMD) registers, which allow for ultra-low-latency lookups in batch. We leverage this unique capability of CPUs to propose NoMAD-Attention, an efficient attention algorithm that replaces MAD operations with in-register lookups. Through hardware-aware algorithmic designs, NoMAD-Attention achieves the computation of attention scores using repeated fast accesses to SIMD registers despite their highly limited sizes. Moreover, NoMAD-Attention works with pre-trained attention-based LLMs without model finetuning. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that NoMAD-Attention maintains the quality of the original LLMs well, and speeds up the 4-bit quantized LLaMA-7B-based model by up to 2$\times$ at 16k context length. Our results are reproducible at https://github.com/tonyzhang617/nomad-dist.

## Dissecting Language Models: Machine Unlearning via Selective Pruning 
  * 2024-03-02  
  * Understanding and shaping the behaviour of Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly important as applications become more powerful and more frequently adopted. This paper introduces a machine unlearning method specifically designed for LLMs. We introduce a selective pruning method for LLMs that removes neurons based on their relative importance on a targeted capability compared to overall network performance. This approach is a compute- and data-efficient method for identifying and removing neurons that enable specific behaviours. Our findings reveal that both feed-forward and attention neurons in LLMs are specialized; that is, for specific tasks, certain neurons are more crucial than others.

## Accelerating Greedy Coordinate Gradient via Probe Sampling 
  * 2024-03-02  
  * Safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a central issue given their rapid progress and wide applications. Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) is shown to be effective in constructing prompts containing adversarial suffixes to break the presumingly safe LLMs, but the optimization of GCG is time-consuming and limits its practicality. To reduce the time cost of GCG and enable more comprehensive studies of LLM safety, in this work, we study a new algorithm called $\texttt{Probe sampling}$ to accelerate the GCG algorithm. At the core of the algorithm is a mechanism that dynamically determines how similar a smaller draft model's predictions are to the target model's predictions for prompt candidates. When the target model is similar to the draft model, we rely heavily on the draft model to filter out a large number of potential prompt candidates to reduce the computation time. Probe sampling achieves up to $5.6$ times speedup using Llama2-7b and leads to equal or improved attack success rate (ASR) on the AdvBench.

## SceneCraft: An LLM Agent for Synthesizing 3D Scene as Blender Code 
  * 2024-03-02  
  * This paper introduces SceneCraft, a Large Language Model (LLM) Agent converting text descriptions into Blender-executable Python scripts which render complex scenes with up to a hundred 3D assets. This process requires complex spatial planning and arrangement. We tackle these challenges through a combination of advanced abstraction, strategic planning, and library learning. SceneCraft first models a scene graph as a blueprint, detailing the spatial relationships among assets in the scene. SceneCraft then writes Python scripts based on this graph, translating relationships into numerical constraints for asset layout. Next, SceneCraft leverages the perceptual strengths of vision-language foundation models like GPT-V to analyze rendered images and iteratively refine the scene. On top of this process, SceneCraft features a library learning mechanism that compiles common script functions into a reusable library, facilitating continuous self-improvement without expensive LLM parameter tuning. Our evaluation demonstrates that SceneCraft surpasses existing LLM-based agents in rendering complex scenes, as shown by its adherence to constraints and favorable human assessments. We also showcase the broader application potential of SceneCraft by reconstructing detailed 3D scenes from the Sintel movie and guiding a video generative model with generated scenes as intermediary control signal.

## Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting in Large Language Models with   Self-Synthesized Rehearsal 
  * 2024-03-02  
  * Large language models (LLMs) suffer from catastrophic forgetting during continual learning. Conventional rehearsal-based methods rely on previous training data to retain the model's ability, which may not be feasible in real-world applications. When conducting continual learning based on a publicly-released LLM checkpoint, the availability of the original training data may be non-existent. To address this challenge, we propose a framework called Self-Synthesized Rehearsal (SSR) that uses the LLM to generate synthetic instances for rehearsal. Concretely, we first employ the base LLM for in-context learning to generate synthetic instances. Subsequently, we utilize the latest LLM to refine the instance outputs based on the synthetic inputs, preserving its acquired ability. Finally, we select diverse high-quality synthetic instances for rehearsal in future stages. Experimental results demonstrate that SSR achieves superior or comparable performance compared to conventional rehearsal-based approaches while being more data-efficient. Besides, SSR effectively preserves the generalization capabilities of LLMs in general domains.

## IntactKV: Improving Large Language Model Quantization by Keeping Pivot   Tokens Intact 
  * 2024-03-02  
  * Large language models (LLMs) excel in natural language processing but demand intensive computation. To mitigate this, various quantization methods have been explored, yet they compromise LLM performance. This paper unveils a previously overlooked type of outlier in LLMs. Such outliers are found to allocate most of the attention scores on initial tokens of input, termed as pivot tokens, which is crucial to the performance of quantized LLMs. Given that, we propose IntactKV to generate the KV cache of pivot tokens losslessly from the full-precision model. The approach is simple and easy to combine with existing quantization solutions. Besides, IntactKV can be calibrated as additional LLM parameters to boost the quantized LLMs further. Mathematical analysis also proves that IntactKV effectively reduces the upper bound of quantization error. Empirical results show that IntactKV brings consistent improvement and achieves lossless weight-only INT4 quantization on various downstream tasks, leading to the new state-of-the-art for LLM quantization.

## API Is Enough: Conformal Prediction for Large Language Models Without   Logit-Access 
  * 2024-03-02  
  * This study aims to address the pervasive challenge of quantifying uncertainty in large language models (LLMs) without logit-access. Conformal Prediction (CP), known for its model-agnostic and distribution-free features, is a desired approach for various LLMs and data distributions. However, existing CP methods for LLMs typically assume access to the logits, which are unavailable for some API-only LLMs. In addition, logits are known to be miscalibrated, potentially leading to degraded CP performance. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel CP method that (1) is tailored for API-only LLMs without logit-access; (2) minimizes the size of prediction sets; and (3) ensures a statistical guarantee of the user-defined coverage. The core idea of this approach is to formulate nonconformity measures using both coarse-grained (i.e., sample frequency) and fine-grained uncertainty notions (e.g., semantic similarity). Experimental results on both close-ended and open-ended Question Answering tasks show our approach can mostly outperform the logit-based CP baselines.

## Data-free Multi-label Image Recognition via LLM-powered Prompt Tuning 
  * 2024-03-02  
  * This paper proposes a novel framework for multi-label image recognition without any training data, called data-free framework, which uses knowledge of pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) to learn prompts to adapt pretrained Vision-Language Model (VLM) like CLIP to multilabel classification. Through asking LLM by well-designed questions, we acquire comprehensive knowledge about characteristics and contexts of objects, which provides valuable text descriptions for learning prompts. Then we propose a hierarchical prompt learning method by taking the multi-label dependency into consideration, wherein a subset of category-specific prompt tokens are shared when the corresponding objects exhibit similar attributes or are more likely to co-occur. Benefiting from the remarkable alignment between visual and linguistic semantics of CLIP, the hierarchical prompts learned from text descriptions are applied to perform classification of images during inference. Our framework presents a new way to explore the synergies between multiple pre-trained models for novel category recognition. Extensive experiments on three public datasets (MS-COCO, VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE) demonstrate that our method achieves better results than the state-of-the-art methods, especially outperforming the zero-shot multi-label recognition methods by 4.7% in mAP on MS-COCO.

## The Case for Animal-Friendly AI 
  * 2024-03-02  
  * Artificial intelligence is seen as increasingly important, and potentially profoundly so, but the fields of AI ethics and AI engineering have not fully recognized that these technologies, including large language models (LLMs), will have massive impacts on animals. We argue that this impact matters, because animals matter morally.   As a first experiment in evaluating animal consideration in LLMs, we constructed a proof-of-concept Evaluation System, which assesses LLM responses and biases from multiple perspectives. This system evaluates LLM outputs by two criteria: their truthfulness, and the degree of consideration they give to the interests of animals. We tested OpenAI ChatGPT 4 and Anthropic Claude 2.1 using a set of structured queries and predefined normative perspectives. Preliminary results suggest that the outcomes of the tested models can be benchmarked regarding the consideration they give to animals, and that generated positions and biases might be addressed and mitigated with more developed and validated systems.   Our research contributes one possible approach to integrating animal ethics in AI, opening pathways for future studies and practical applications in various fields, including education, public policy, and regulation, that involve or relate to animals and society. Overall, this study serves as a step towards more useful and responsible AI systems that better recognize and respect the vital interests and perspectives of all sentient beings.

## DMoERM: Recipes of Mixture-of-Experts for Effective Reward Modeling 
  * 2024-03-02  
  * The performance of the reward model (RM) is a critical factor in improving the effectiveness of the large language model (LLM) during alignment fine-tuning. There remain two challenges in RM training: 1) training the same RM using various categories of data may cause its generalization performance to suffer from multi-task disturbance, and 2) the human annotation consistency rate is generally only $60\%$ to $75\%$, causing training data to contain a lot of noise. To tackle these two challenges, we introduced the idea of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) into the field of RM for the first time. We propose the Double-Layer MoE RM (DMoERM). The outer layer MoE is a sparse model. After classifying an input into task categories, we route it to the corresponding inner layer task-specific model. The inner layer MoE is a dense model. We decompose the specific task into multiple capability dimensions and individually fine-tune a LoRA expert on each one. Their outputs are then synthesized by an MLP to compute the final rewards. To minimize costs, we call a public LLM API to obtain the capability preference labels. The validation on manually labeled datasets confirms that our model attains superior consistency with human preference and outstrips advanced generative approaches. Meanwhile, through BoN sampling and RL experiments, we demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art ensemble methods of RM and mitigates the overoptimization problem. Our code and dataset are available at: https://github.com/quanshr/DMoERM-v1.

## RAGged Edges: The Double-Edged Sword of Retrieval-Augmented Chatbots 
  * 2024-03-02  
  * Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT demonstrate the remarkable progress of artificial intelligence. However, their tendency to hallucinate -- generate plausible but false information -- poses a significant challenge. This issue is critical, as seen in recent court cases where ChatGPT's use led to citations of non-existent legal rulings. This paper explores how Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can counter hallucinations by integrating external knowledge with prompts. We empirically evaluate RAG against standard LLMs using prompts designed to induce hallucinations. Our results show that RAG increases accuracy in some cases, but can still be misled when prompts directly contradict the model's pre-trained understanding. These findings highlight the complex nature of hallucinations and the need for more robust solutions to ensure LLM reliability in real-world applications. We offer practical recommendations for RAG deployment and discuss implications for the development of more trustworthy LLMs.

## Balancing Exploration and Exploitation in LLM using Soft RLLF for   Enhanced Negation Understanding 
  * 2024-03-02  
  * Finetuning approaches in NLP often focus on exploitation rather than exploration, which may lead to suboptimal models. Given the vast search space of natural language, this limited exploration can restrict their performance in complex, high-stakes domains, where accurate negation understanding and logical reasoning abilities are crucial. To address this issue, we leverage Reinforcement Learning from Logical Feedback (RLLF) to create an effective balance between exploration and exploitation in LLMs. Our approach employs an appropriate benchmark dataset for training and evaluation, highlighting the importance of exploration in enhancing negation understanding capabilities. We compare the performance of our RLLF-enhanced LLMs with baseline models trained without RLLF, demonstrating the value of this balanced approach. Furthermore, we showcase the potential of our method in legal AI applications by employing transfer learning and evaluating its impact on negation understanding. Our experimental results exhibit the effectiveness of balancing exploration and exploitation with RLLF in improving LLMs' negation capabilities. This has implications for the development of more accurate, reliable, and logically consistent language models in high-stakes domains.

## STAR: Constraint LoRA with Dynamic Active Learning for Data-Efficient   Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models 
  * 2024-03-02  
  * Though Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the powerful capabilities of few-shot learning through prompting methods, supervised training is still necessary for complex reasoning tasks. Because of their extensive parameters and memory consumption, both Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods and Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning methods have been proposed for LLMs. Nevertheless, the issue of large annotated data consumption, the aim of Data-Efficient Fine-Tuning, remains unexplored. One obvious way is to combine the PEFT method with active learning. However, the experimental results show that such a combination is not trivial and yields inferior results. Through probe experiments, such observation might be explained by two main reasons: uncertainty gap and poor model calibration. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel approach to effectively integrate uncertainty-based active learning and LoRA. Specifically, for the uncertainty gap, we introduce a dynamic uncertainty measurement that combines the uncertainty of the base model and the uncertainty of the full model during the iteration of active learning. For poor model calibration, we incorporate the regularization method during LoRA training to keep the model from being over-confident, and the Monte-Carlo dropout mechanism is employed to enhance the uncertainty estimation. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms existing baseline models on three complex reasoning tasks.

## A Survey of AI-generated Text Forensic Systems: Detection, Attribution,   and Characterization 
  * 2024-03-02  
  * We have witnessed lately a rapid proliferation of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of generating high-quality text. While these LLMs have revolutionized text generation across various domains, they also pose significant risks to the information ecosystem, such as the potential for generating convincing propaganda, misinformation, and disinformation at scale. This paper offers a review of AI-generated text forensic systems, an emerging field addressing the challenges of LLM misuses. We present an overview of the existing efforts in AI-generated text forensics by introducing a detailed taxonomy, focusing on three primary pillars: detection, attribution, and characterization. These pillars enable a practical understanding of AI-generated text, from identifying AI-generated content (detection), determining the specific AI model involved (attribution), and grouping the underlying intents of the text (characterization). Furthermore, we explore available resources for AI-generated text forensics research and discuss the evolving challenges and future directions of forensic systems in an AI era.

## ParallelPARC: A Scalable Pipeline for Generating Natural-Language   Analogies 
  * 2024-03-02  
  * Analogy-making is central to human cognition, allowing us to adapt to novel situations -- an ability that current AI systems still lack. Most analogy datasets today focus on simple analogies (e.g., word analogies); datasets including complex types of analogies are typically manually curated and very small. We believe that this holds back progress in computational analogy. In this work, we design a data generation pipeline, ParallelPARC (Parallel Paragraph Creator) leveraging state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to create complex, paragraph-based analogies, as well as distractors, both simple and challenging. We demonstrate our pipeline and create ProPara-Logy, a dataset of analogies between scientific processes. We publish a gold-set, validated by humans, and a silver-set, generated automatically. We test LLMs' and humans' analogy recognition in binary and multiple-choice settings, and found that humans outperform the best models (~13% gap) after a light supervision. We demonstrate that our silver-set is useful for training models. Lastly, we show challenging distractors confuse LLMs, but not humans. We hope our pipeline will encourage research in this emerging field.

## LLM-PQ: Serving LLM on Heterogeneous Clusters with Phase-Aware Partition   and Adaptive Quantization 
  * 2024-03-02  
  * Recent breakthroughs in Large-scale language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on various tasks. The immense sizes of LLMs have led to very high resource demand and cost for running the models. Though the models are largely served using uniform high-caliber GPUs nowadays, utilizing a heterogeneous cluster with a mix of available high- and low-capacity GPUs can potentially substantially reduce the serving cost. There is a lack of designs to support efficient LLM serving using a heterogeneous cluster, while the current solutions focus on model partition and uniform compression among homogeneous devices. This paper proposes LLM-PQ, a system that advocates adaptive model quantization and phase-aware partition to improve LLM serving efficiency on heterogeneous GPU clusters. We carefully decide on mixed-precision model quantization together with phase-aware model partition and micro-batch sizing in distributed LLM serving with an efficient algorithm, to greatly enhance inference throughput while fulfilling user-specified model quality targets. Extensive experiments on production inference workloads in 11 different clusters demonstrate that LLM-PQ achieves up to 2.88x (2.26x on average) throughput improvement in inference, showing great advantages over state-of-the-art works.

## Evaluating Large Language Models as Virtual Annotators for Time-series   Physical Sensing Data 
  * 2024-03-02  
  * Traditional human-in-the-loop-based annotation for time-series data like inertial data often requires access to alternate modalities like video or audio from the environment. These alternate sources provide the necessary information to the human annotator, as the raw numeric data is often too obfuscated even for an expert. However, this traditional approach has many concerns surrounding overall cost, efficiency, storage of additional modalities, time, scalability, and privacy. Interestingly, recent large language models (LLMs) are also trained with vast amounts of publicly available alphanumeric data, which allows them to comprehend and perform well on tasks beyond natural language processing. Naturally, this opens up a potential avenue to explore LLMs as virtual annotators where the LLMs will be directly provided the raw sensor data for annotation instead of relying on any alternate modality. Naturally, this could mitigate the problems of the traditional human-in-the-loop approach. Motivated by this observation, we perform a detailed study in this paper to assess whether the state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs can be used as virtual annotators for labeling time-series physical sensing data. To perform this in a principled manner, we segregate the study into two major phases. In the first phase, we investigate the challenges an LLM like GPT-4 faces in comprehending raw sensor data. Considering the observations from phase 1, in the next phase, we investigate the possibility of encoding the raw sensor data using SOTA SSL approaches and utilizing the projected time-series data to get annotations from the LLM. Detailed evaluation with four benchmark HAR datasets shows that SSL-based encoding and metric-based guidance allow the LLM to make more reasonable decisions and provide accurate annotations without requiring computationally expensive fine-tuning or sophisticated prompt engineering.

## LLaMoCo: Instruction Tuning of Large Language Models for Optimization   Code Generation 
  * 2024-03-02  
  * Recent research explores optimization using large language models (LLMs) by either iteratively seeking next-step solutions from LLMs or directly prompting LLMs for an optimizer. However, these approaches exhibit inherent limitations, including low operational efficiency, high sensitivity to prompt design, and a lack of domain-specific knowledge. We introduce LLaMoCo, the first instruction-tuning framework designed to adapt LLMs for solving optimization problems in a code-to-code manner. Specifically, we establish a comprehensive instruction set containing well-described problem prompts and effective optimization codes. We then develop a novel two-phase learning strategy that incorporates a contrastive learning-based warm-up procedure before the instruction-tuning phase to enhance the convergence behavior during model fine-tuning. The experiment results demonstrate that a CodeGen (350M) model fine-tuned by our LLaMoCo achieves superior optimization performance compared to GPT-4 Turbo and the other competitors across both synthetic and realistic problem sets. The fine-tuned model and the usage instructions are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLaMoCo-722A.

## OpenGraph: Towards Open Graph Foundation Models 
  * 2024-03-02  
  * Graph learning has become indispensable for interpreting and harnessing relational data in diverse fields, ranging from recommendation systems to social network analysis. In this context, a variety of GNNs have emerged as promising methodologies for encoding the structural information of graphs. By effectively capturing the graph's underlying structure, these GNNs have shown great potential in enhancing performance in graph learning tasks, such as link prediction and node classification. However, despite their successes, a significant challenge persists: these advanced methods often face difficulties in generalizing to unseen graph data that significantly differs from the training instances. In this work, our aim is to advance the graph learning paradigm by developing a general graph foundation model. This model is designed to understand the complex topological patterns present in diverse graph data, enabling it to excel in zero-shot graph learning tasks across different downstream datasets. To achieve this goal, we address several key technical challenges in our OpenGraph model. Firstly, we propose a unified graph tokenizer to adapt our graph model to generalize well on unseen graph data, even when the underlying graph properties differ significantly from those encountered during training. Secondly, we develop a scalable graph transformer as the foundational encoder, which effectively captures node-wise dependencies within the global topological context. Thirdly, we introduce a data augmentation mechanism enhanced by a LLM to alleviate the limitations of data scarcity in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework. By adapting our OpenGraph to new graph characteristics and comprehending the nuances of diverse graphs, our approach achieves remarkable zero-shot graph learning performance across various settings and domains.

## Distilling Text Style Transfer With Self-Explanation From LLMs 
  * 2024-03-02  
  * Text Style Transfer (TST) seeks to alter the style of text while retaining its core content. Given the constraints of limited parallel datasets for TST, we propose CoTeX, a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) alongside chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to facilitate TST. CoTeX distills the complex rewriting and reasoning capabilities of LLMs into more streamlined models capable of working with both non-parallel and parallel data. Through experimentation across four TST datasets, CoTeX is shown to surpass traditional supervised fine-tuning and knowledge distillation methods, particularly in low-resource settings. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation, comparing CoTeX against current unsupervised, supervised, in-context learning (ICL) techniques, and instruction-tuned LLMs. Furthermore, CoTeX distinguishes itself by offering transparent explanations for its style transfer process.

## LAB: Large-Scale Alignment for ChatBots 
  * 2024-03-02  
  * This work introduces LAB (Large-scale Alignment for chatBots), a novel methodology designed to overcome the scalability challenges in the instruction-tuning phase of large language model (LLM) training. Leveraging a taxonomy-guided synthetic data generation process and a multi-phase tuning framework, LAB significantly reduces reliance on expensive human annotations and proprietary models like GPT-4. We demonstrate that LAB-trained models can achieve competitive performance across several benchmarks compared to models trained with traditional human-annotated or GPT-4 generated synthetic data. Thus offering a scalable, cost-effective solution for enhancing LLM capabilities and instruction-following behaviors without the drawbacks of catastrophic forgetting, marking a step forward in the efficient training of LLMs for a wide range of applications.

## LLMCRIT: Teaching Large Language Models to Use Criteria 
  * 2024-03-02  
  * Humans follow criteria when they execute tasks, and these criteria are directly used to assess the quality of task completion. Therefore, having models learn to use criteria to provide feedback can help humans or models to perform tasks better. However, existing research in this field tends to consider only a limited set of criteria or quality assessment aspects. To fill this gap, we propose a general framework that enables large language models (LLMs) to use comprehensive criteria for a task in delivering natural language feedback on task execution. In particular, we present a model-in-the-loop framework that semi-automatically derives criteria from collected guidelines for different writing tasks and constructs in-context demonstrations for each criterion. We choose three tasks from real-world scenarios to operationalize this idea: paper introduction writing, Python code writing, and Reddit post writing, and evaluate our feedback generation framework using different LLMs. The results reveal the fine-grained effects of incorporating criteria and demonstrations and provide valuable insights on how to teach LLMs to use criteria more effectively.

## FaiMA: Feature-aware In-context Learning for Multi-domain Aspect-based   Sentiment Analysis 
  * 2024-03-02  
  * Multi-domain aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) seeks to capture fine-grained sentiment across diverse domains. While existing research narrowly focuses on single-domain applications constrained by methodological limitations and data scarcity, the reality is that sentiment naturally traverses multiple domains. Although large language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution for ABSA, it is difficult to integrate effectively with established techniques, including graph-based models and linguistics, because modifying their internal architecture is not easy. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel framework, Feature-aware In-context Learning for Multi-domain ABSA (FaiMA). The core insight of FaiMA is to utilize in-context learning (ICL) as a feature-aware mechanism that facilitates adaptive learning in multi-domain ABSA tasks. Specifically, we employ a multi-head graph attention network as a text encoder optimized by heuristic rules for linguistic, domain, and sentiment features. Through contrastive learning, we optimize sentence representations by focusing on these diverse features. Additionally, we construct an efficient indexing mechanism, allowing FaiMA to stably retrieve highly relevant examples across multiple dimensions for any given input. To evaluate the efficacy of FaiMA, we build the first multi-domain ABSA benchmark dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that FaiMA achieves significant performance improvements in multiple domains compared to baselines, increasing F1 by 2.07% on average.

## Reading Subtext: Evaluating Large Language Models on Short Story   Summarization with Writers 
  * 2024-03-02  
  * We evaluate recent Large language Models (LLMs) on the challenging task of summarizing short stories, which can be lengthy, and include nuanced subtext or scrambled timelines. Importantly, we work directly with authors to ensure that the stories have not been shared online (and therefore are unseen by the models), and to obtain informed evaluations of summary quality using judgments from the authors themselves. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis grounded in narrative theory, we compare GPT-4, Claude-2.1, and LLama-2-70B. We find that all three models make faithfulness mistakes in over 50% of summaries and struggle to interpret difficult subtext. However, at their best, the models can provide thoughtful thematic analysis of stories. We additionally demonstrate that LLM judgments of summary quality do not match the feedback from the writers.

## Towards Full Authorship with AI: Supporting Revision with AI-Generated   Views 
  * 2024-03-02  
  * Large language models (LLMs) are shaping a new user interface (UI) paradigm in writing tools by enabling users to generate text through prompts. This paradigm shifts some creative control from the user to the system, thereby diminishing the user's authorship and autonomy in the writing process. To restore autonomy, we introduce Textfocals, a UI prototype designed to investigate a human-centered approach that emphasizes the user's role in writing. Textfocals supports the writing process by providing LLM-generated summaries, questions, and advice (i.e., LLM views) in a sidebar of a text editor, encouraging reflection and self-driven revision in writing without direct text generation. Textfocals' UI affordances, including contextually adaptive views and scaffolding for prompt selection and customization, offer a novel way to interact with LLMs where users maintain full authorship of their writing. A formative user study with Textfocals showed promising evidence that this approach might help users develop underdeveloped ideas, cater to the rhetorical audience, and clarify their writing. However, the study also showed interaction design challenges related to document navigation and scoping, prompt engineering, and context management. Our work highlights the breadth of the design space of writing support interfaces powered by generative AI that maintain authorship integrity.

## AutoAttacker: A Large Language Model Guided System to Implement   Automatic Cyber-attacks 
  * 2024-03-02  
  * Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive results on natural language tasks, and security researchers are beginning to employ them in both offensive and defensive systems. In cyber-security, there have been multiple research efforts that utilize LLMs focusing on the pre-breach stage of attacks like phishing and malware generation. However, so far there lacks a comprehensive study regarding whether LLM-based systems can be leveraged to simulate the post-breach stage of attacks that are typically human-operated, or "hands-on-keyboard" attacks, under various attack techniques and environments.   As LLMs inevitably advance, they may be able to automate both the pre- and post-breach attack stages. This shift may transform organizational attacks from rare, expert-led events to frequent, automated operations requiring no expertise and executed at automation speed and scale. This risks fundamentally changing global computer security and correspondingly causing substantial economic impacts, and a goal of this work is to better understand these risks now so we can better prepare for these inevitable ever-more-capable LLMs on the horizon. On the immediate impact side, this research serves three purposes. First, an automated LLM-based, post-breach exploitation framework can help analysts quickly test and continually improve their organization's network security posture against previously unseen attacks. Second, an LLM-based penetration test system can extend the effectiveness of red teams with a limited number of human analysts. Finally, this research can help defensive systems and teams learn to detect novel attack behaviors preemptively before their use in the wild....

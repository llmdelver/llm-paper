## Explorative Inbetweening of Time and Space 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * We introduce bounded generation as a generalized task to control video generation to synthesize arbitrary camera and subject motion based only on a given start and end frame. Our objective is to fully leverage the inherent generalization capability of an image-to-video model without additional training or fine-tuning of the original model. This is achieved through the proposed new sampling strategy, which we call Time Reversal Fusion, that fuses the temporally forward and backward denoising paths conditioned on the start and end frame, respectively. The fused path results in a video that smoothly connects the two frames, generating inbetweening of faithful subject motion, novel views of static scenes, and seamless video looping when the two bounding frames are identical. We curate a diverse evaluation dataset of image pairs and compare against the closest existing methods. We find that Time Reversal Fusion outperforms related work on all subtasks, exhibiting the ability to generate complex motions and 3D-consistent views guided by bounded frames.

## Click to Grasp: Zero-Shot Precise Manipulation via Visual Diffusion   Descriptors 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * Precise manipulation that is generalizable across scenes and objects remains a persistent challenge in robotics. Current approaches for this task heavily depend on having a significant number of training instances to handle objects with pronounced visual and/or geometric part ambiguities. Our work explores the grounding of fine-grained part descriptors for precise manipulation in a zero-shot setting by utilizing web-trained text-to-image diffusion-based generative models. We tackle the problem by framing it as a dense semantic part correspondence task. Our model returns a gripper pose for manipulating a specific part, using as reference a user-defined click from a source image of a visually different instance of the same object. We require no manual grasping demonstrations as we leverage the intrinsic object geometry and features. Practical experiments in a real-world tabletop scenario validate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating its potential for advancing semantic-aware robotics manipulation.

## DesignEdit: Multi-Layered Latent Decomposition and Fusion for Unified &   Accurate Image Editing 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * Recently, how to achieve precise image editing has attracted increasing attention, especially given the remarkable success of text-to-image generation models. To unify various spatial-aware image editing abilities into one framework, we adopt the concept of layers from the design domain to manipulate objects flexibly with various operations. The key insight is to transform the spatial-aware image editing task into a combination of two sub-tasks: multi-layered latent decomposition and multi-layered latent fusion. First, we segment the latent representations of the source images into multiple layers, which include several object layers and one incomplete background layer that necessitates reliable inpainting. To avoid extra tuning, we further explore the inner inpainting ability within the self-attention mechanism. We introduce a key-masking self-attention scheme that can propagate the surrounding context information into the masked region while mitigating its impact on the regions outside the mask. Second, we propose an instruction-guided latent fusion that pastes the multi-layered latent representations onto a canvas latent. We also introduce an artifact suppression scheme in the latent space to enhance the inpainting quality. Due to the inherent modular advantages of such multi-layered representations, we can achieve accurate image editing, and we demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses the latest spatial editing methods, including Self-Guidance and DiffEditor. Last, we show that our approach is a unified framework that supports various accurate image editing tasks on more than six different editing tasks.

## AnyV2V: A Plug-and-Play Framework For Any Video-to-Video Editing Tasks 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * Video-to-video editing involves editing a source video along with additional control (such as text prompts, subjects, or styles) to generate a new video that aligns with the source video and the provided control. Traditional methods have been constrained to certain editing types, limiting their ability to meet the wide range of user demands. In this paper, we introduce AnyV2V, a novel training-free framework designed to simplify video editing into two primary steps: (1) employing an off-the-shelf image editing model (e.g. InstructPix2Pix, InstantID, etc) to modify the first frame, (2) utilizing an existing image-to-video generation model (e.g. I2VGen-XL) for DDIM inversion and feature injection. In the first stage, AnyV2V can plug in any existing image editing tools to support an extensive array of video editing tasks. Beyond the traditional prompt-based editing methods, AnyV2V also can support novel video editing tasks, including reference-based style transfer, subject-driven editing, and identity manipulation, which were unattainable by previous methods. In the second stage, AnyV2V can plug in any existing image-to-video models to perform DDIM inversion and intermediate feature injection to maintain the appearance and motion consistency with the source video. On the prompt-based editing, we show that AnyV2V can outperform the previous best approach by 35\% on prompt alignment, and 25\% on human preference. On the three novel tasks, we show that AnyV2V also achieves a high success rate. We believe AnyV2V will continue to thrive due to its ability to seamlessly integrate the fast-evolving image editing methods. Such compatibility can help AnyV2V to increase its versatility to cater to diverse user demands.

## Analysing Diffusion Segmentation for Medical Images 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic models have become increasingly popular due to their ability to offer probabilistic modeling and generate diverse outputs. This versatility inspired their adaptation for image segmentation, where multiple predictions of the model can produce segmentation results that not only achieve high quality but also capture the uncertainty inherent in the model. Here, powerful architectures were proposed for improving diffusion segmentation performance. However, there is a notable lack of analysis and discussions on the differences between diffusion segmentation and image generation, and thorough evaluations are missing that distinguish the improvements these architectures provide for segmentation in general from their benefit for diffusion segmentation specifically. In this work, we critically analyse and discuss how diffusion segmentation for medical images differs from diffusion image generation, with a particular focus on the training behavior. Furthermore, we conduct an assessment how proposed diffusion segmentation architectures perform when trained directly for segmentation. Lastly, we explore how different medical segmentation tasks influence the diffusion segmentation behavior and the diffusion process could be adapted accordingly. With these analyses, we aim to provide in-depth insights into the behavior of diffusion segmentation that allow for a better design and evaluation of diffusion segmentation methods in the future.

## Style-Extracting Diffusion Models for Semi-Supervised Histopathology   Segmentation 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * Deep learning-based image generation has seen significant advancements with diffusion models, notably improving the quality of generated images. Despite these developments, generating images with unseen characteristics beneficial for downstream tasks has received limited attention. To bridge this gap, we propose Style-Extracting Diffusion Models, featuring two conditioning mechanisms. Specifically, we utilize 1) a style conditioning mechanism which allows to inject style information of previously unseen images during image generation and 2) a content conditioning which can be targeted to a downstream task, e.g., layout for segmentation. We introduce a trainable style encoder to extract style information from images, and an aggregation block that merges style information from multiple style inputs. This architecture enables the generation of images with unseen styles in a zero-shot manner, by leveraging styles from unseen images, resulting in more diverse generations. In this work, we use the image layout as target condition and first show the capability of our method on a natural image dataset as a proof-of-concept. We further demonstrate its versatility in histopathology, where we combine prior knowledge about tissue composition and unannotated data to create diverse synthetic images with known layouts. This allows us to generate additional synthetic data to train a segmentation network in a semi-supervised fashion. We verify the added value of the generated images by showing improved segmentation results and lower performance variability between patients when synthetic images are included during segmentation training. Our code will be made publicly available at [LINK].

## DP-RDM: Adapting Diffusion Models to Private Domains Without Fine-Tuning 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * Text-to-image diffusion models have been shown to suffer from sample-level memorization, possibly reproducing near-perfect replica of images that they are trained on, which may be undesirable. To remedy this issue, we develop the first differentially private (DP) retrieval-augmented generation algorithm that is capable of generating high-quality image samples while providing provable privacy guarantees. Specifically, we assume access to a text-to-image diffusion model trained on a small amount of public data, and design a DP retrieval mechanism to augment the text prompt with samples retrieved from a private retrieval dataset. Our \emph{differentially private retrieval-augmented diffusion model} (DP-RDM) requires no fine-tuning on the retrieval dataset to adapt to another domain, and can use state-of-the-art generative models to generate high-quality image samples while satisfying rigorous DP guarantees. For instance, when evaluated on MS-COCO, our DP-RDM can generate samples with a privacy budget of $\epsilon=10$, while providing a $3.5$ point improvement in FID compared to public-only retrieval for up to $10,000$ queries.

## Enabling Visual Composition and Animation in Unsupervised Video   Generation 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * In this work we propose a novel method for unsupervised controllable video generation. Once trained on a dataset of unannotated videos, at inference our model is capable of both composing scenes of predefined object parts and animating them in a plausible and controlled way. This is achieved by conditioning video generation on a randomly selected subset of local pre-trained self-supervised features during training. We call our model CAGE for visual Composition and Animation for video GEneration. We conduct a series of experiments to demonstrate capabilities of CAGE in various settings.

## Open-Vocabulary Attention Maps with Token Optimization for Semantic   Segmentation in Diffusion Models 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * Diffusion models represent a new paradigm in text-to-image generation. Beyond generating high-quality images from text prompts, models such as Stable Diffusion have been successfully extended to the joint generation of semantic segmentation pseudo-masks. However, current extensions primarily rely on extracting attentions linked to prompt words used for image synthesis. This approach limits the generation of segmentation masks derived from word tokens not contained in the text prompt. In this work, we introduce Open-Vocabulary Attention Maps (OVAM)-a training-free method for text-to-image diffusion models that enables the generation of attention maps for any word. In addition, we propose a lightweight optimization process based on OVAM for finding tokens that generate accurate attention maps for an object class with a single annotation. We evaluate these tokens within existing state-of-the-art Stable Diffusion extensions. The best-performing model improves its mIoU from 52.1 to 86.6 for the synthetic images' pseudo-masks, demonstrating that our optimized tokens are an efficient way to improve the performance of existing methods without architectural changes or retraining.

## A Framework for Portrait Stylization with Skin-Tone Awareness and Nudity   Identification 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * Portrait stylization is a challenging task involving the transformation of an input portrait image into a specific style while preserving its inherent characteristics. The recent introduction of Stable Diffusion (SD) has significantly improved the quality of outcomes in this field. However, a practical stylization framework that can effectively filter harmful input content and preserve the distinct characteristics of an input, such as skin-tone, while maintaining the quality of stylization remains lacking. These challenges have hindered the wide deployment of such a framework. To address these issues, this study proposes a portrait stylization framework that incorporates a nudity content identification module (NCIM) and a skin-tone-aware portrait stylization module (STAPSM). In experiments, NCIM showed good performance in enhancing explicit content filtering, and STAPSM accurately represented a diverse range of skin tones. Our proposed framework has been successfully deployed in practice, and it has effectively satisfied critical requirements of real-world applications.

## Safeguarding Medical Image Segmentation Datasets against Unauthorized   Training via Contour- and Texture-Aware Perturbations 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * The widespread availability of publicly accessible medical images has significantly propelled advancements in various research and clinical fields. Nonetheless, concerns regarding unauthorized training of AI systems for commercial purposes and the duties of patient privacy protection have led numerous institutions to hesitate to share their images. This is particularly true for medical image segmentation (MIS) datasets, where the processes of collection and fine-grained annotation are time-intensive and laborious. Recently, Unlearnable Examples (UEs) methods have shown the potential to protect images by adding invisible shortcuts. These shortcuts can prevent unauthorized deep neural networks from generalizing. However, existing UEs are designed for natural image classification and fail to protect MIS datasets imperceptibly as their protective perturbations are less learnable than important prior knowledge in MIS, e.g., contour and texture features. To this end, we propose an Unlearnable Medical image generation method, termed UMed. UMed integrates the prior knowledge of MIS by injecting contour- and texture-aware perturbations to protect images. Given that our target is to only poison features critical to MIS, UMed requires only minimal perturbations within the ROI and its contour to achieve greater imperceptibility (average PSNR is 50.03) and protective performance (clean average DSC degrades from 82.18% to 6.80%).

## StyleCineGAN: Landscape Cinemagraph Generation using a Pre-trained   StyleGAN 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * We propose a method that can generate cinemagraphs automatically from a still landscape image using a pre-trained StyleGAN. Inspired by the success of recent unconditional video generation, we leverage a powerful pre-trained image generator to synthesize high-quality cinemagraphs. Unlike previous approaches that mainly utilize the latent space of a pre-trained StyleGAN, our approach utilizes its deep feature space for both GAN inversion and cinemagraph generation. Specifically, we propose multi-scale deep feature warping (MSDFW), which warps the intermediate features of a pre-trained StyleGAN at different resolutions. By using MSDFW, the generated cinemagraphs are of high resolution and exhibit plausible looping animation. We demonstrate the superiority of our method through user studies and quantitative comparisons with state-of-the-art cinemagraph generation methods and a video generation method that uses a pre-trained StyleGAN.

## Harmonizing Visual and Textual Embeddings for Zero-Shot Text-to-Image   Customization 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * In a surge of text-to-image (T2I) models and their customization methods that generate new images of a user-provided subject, current works focus on alleviating the costs incurred by a lengthy per-subject optimization. These zero-shot customization methods encode the image of a specified subject into a visual embedding which is then utilized alongside the textual embedding for diffusion guidance. The visual embedding incorporates intrinsic information about the subject, while the textual embedding provides a new, transient context. However, the existing methods often 1) are significantly affected by the input images, eg., generating images with the same pose, and 2) exhibit deterioration in the subject's identity. We first pin down the problem and show that redundant pose information in the visual embedding interferes with the textual embedding containing the desired pose information. To address this issue, we propose orthogonal visual embedding which effectively harmonizes with the given textual embedding. We also adopt the visual-only embedding and inject the subject's clear features utilizing a self-attention swap. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, which offers highly flexible zero-shot generation while effectively maintaining the subject's identity.

## Efficient Video Diffusion Models via Content-Frame Motion-Latent   Decomposition 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * Video diffusion models have recently made great progress in generation quality, but are still limited by the high memory and computational requirements. This is because current video diffusion models often attempt to process high-dimensional videos directly. To tackle this issue, we propose content-motion latent diffusion model (CMD), a novel efficient extension of pretrained image diffusion models for video generation. Specifically, we propose an autoencoder that succinctly encodes a video as a combination of a content frame (like an image) and a low-dimensional motion latent representation. The former represents the common content, and the latter represents the underlying motion in the video, respectively. We generate the content frame by fine-tuning a pretrained image diffusion model, and we generate the motion latent representation by training a new lightweight diffusion model. A key innovation here is the design of a compact latent space that can directly utilizes a pretrained image diffusion model, which has not been done in previous latent video diffusion models. This leads to considerably better quality generation and reduced computational costs. For instance, CMD can sample a video 7.7$\times$ faster than prior approaches by generating a video of 512$\times$1024 resolution and length 16 in 3.1 seconds. Moreover, CMD achieves an FVD score of 212.7 on WebVid-10M, 27.3% better than the previous state-of-the-art of 292.4.

## QSMDiff: Unsupervised 3D Diffusion Models for Quantitative   Susceptibility Mapping 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) dipole inversion is an ill-posed inverse problem for quantifying magnetic susceptibility distributions from MRI tissue phases. While supervised deep learning methods have shown success in specific QSM tasks, their generalizability across different acquisition scenarios remains constrained. Recent developments in diffusion models have demonstrated potential for solving 2D medical imaging inverse problems. However, their application to 3D modalities, such as QSM, remains challenging due to high computational demands. In this work, we developed a 3D image patch-based diffusion model, namely QSMDiff, for robust QSM reconstruction across different scan parameters, alongside simultaneous super-resolution and image-denoising tasks. QSMDiff adopts unsupervised 3D image patch training and full-size measurement guidance during inference for controlled image generation. Evaluation on simulated and in-vivo human brains, using gradient-echo and echo-planar imaging sequences across different acquisition parameters, demonstrates superior performance. The method proposed in QSMDiff also holds promise for impacting other 3D medical imaging applications beyond QSM.

## Beyond Finite Data: Towards Data-free Out-of-distribution Generalization   via Extrapola 
  * 2024-03-08  
  * Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization is a favorable yet challenging property for deep neural networks. The core challenges lie in the limited availability of source domains that help models learn an invariant representation from the spurious features. Various domain augmentation have been proposed but largely rely on interpolating existing domains and frequently face difficulties in creating truly "novel" domains. Humans, on the other hand, can easily extrapolate novel domains, thus, an intriguing question arises: How can neural networks extrapolate like humans and achieve OOD generalization?   We introduce a novel approach to domain extrapolation that leverages reasoning ability and the extensive knowledge encapsulated within large language models (LLMs) to synthesize entirely new domains. Starting with the class of interest, we query the LLMs to extract relevant knowledge for these novel domains. We then bridge the gap between the text-centric knowledge derived from LLMs and the pixel input space of the model using text-to-image generation techniques. By augmenting the training set of domain generalization datasets with high-fidelity, photo-realistic images of these new domains, we achieve significant improvements over all existing methods, as demonstrated in both single and multi-domain generalization across various benchmarks.   With the ability to extrapolate any domains for any class, our method has the potential to learn a generalized model for any task without any data. To illustrate, we put forth a much more difficult setting termed, data-free domain generalization, that aims to learn a generalized model in the absence of any collected data. Our empirical findings support the above argument and our methods exhibit commendable performance in this setting, even surpassing the supervised setting by approximately 1-2\% on datasets such as VLCS.

## VideoElevator: Elevating Video Generation Quality with Versatile   Text-to-Image Diffusion Models 
  * 2024-03-08  
  * Text-to-image diffusion models (T2I) have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in creating realistic and aesthetic images. On the contrary, text-to-video diffusion models (T2V) still lag far behind in frame quality and text alignment, owing to insufficient quality and quantity of training videos. In this paper, we introduce VideoElevator, a training-free and plug-and-play method, which elevates the performance of T2V using superior capabilities of T2I. Different from conventional T2V sampling (i.e., temporal and spatial modeling), VideoElevator explicitly decomposes each sampling step into temporal motion refining and spatial quality elevating. Specifically, temporal motion refining uses encapsulated T2V to enhance temporal consistency, followed by inverting to the noise distribution required by T2I. Then, spatial quality elevating harnesses inflated T2I to directly predict less noisy latent, adding more photo-realistic details. We have conducted experiments in extensive prompts under the combination of various T2V and T2I. The results show that VideoElevator not only improves the performance of T2V baselines with foundational T2I, but also facilitates stylistic video synthesis with personalized T2I. Our code is available at https://github.com/YBYBZhang/VideoElevator.

## A Data Augmentation Pipeline to Generate Synthetic Labeled Datasets of   3D Echocardiography Images using a GAN 
  * 2024-03-08  
  * Due to privacy issues and limited amount of publicly available labeled datasets in the domain of medical imaging, we propose an image generation pipeline to synthesize 3D echocardiographic images with corresponding ground truth labels, to alleviate the need for data collection and for laborious and error-prone human labeling of images for subsequent Deep Learning (DL) tasks. The proposed method utilizes detailed anatomical segmentations of the heart as ground truth label sources. This initial dataset is combined with a second dataset made up of real 3D echocardiographic images to train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to synthesize realistic 3D cardiovascular Ultrasound images paired with ground truth labels. To generate the synthetic 3D dataset, the trained GAN uses high resolution anatomical models from Computed Tomography (CT) as input. A qualitative analysis of the synthesized images showed that the main structures of the heart are well delineated and closely follow the labels obtained from the anatomical models. To assess the usability of these synthetic images for DL tasks, segmentation algorithms were trained to delineate the left ventricle, left atrium, and myocardium. A quantitative analysis of the 3D segmentations given by the models trained with the synthetic images indicated the potential use of this GAN approach to generate 3D synthetic data, use the data to train DL models for different clinical tasks, and therefore tackle the problem of scarcity of 3D labeled echocardiography datasets.

## Fine-tuning a Multiple Instance Learning Feature Extractor with Masked   Context Modelling and Knowledge Distillation 
  * 2024-03-08  
  * The first step in Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) algorithms for Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification consists of tiling the input image into smaller patches and computing their feature vectors produced by a pre-trained feature extractor model. Feature extractor models that were pre-trained with supervision on ImageNet have proven to transfer well to this domain, however, this pre-training task does not take into account that visual information in neighboring patches is highly correlated. Based on this observation, we propose to increase downstream MIL classification by fine-tuning the feature extractor model using \textit{Masked Context Modelling with Knowledge Distillation}. In this task, the feature extractor model is fine-tuned by predicting masked patches in a bigger context window. Since reconstructing the input image would require a powerful image generation model, and our goal is not to generate realistically looking image patches, we predict instead the feature vectors produced by a larger teacher network. A single epoch of the proposed task suffices to increase the downstream performance of the feature-extractor model when used in a MIL scenario, even capable of outperforming the downstream performance of the teacher model, while being considerably smaller and requiring a fraction of its compute.

## Towards Effective Usage of Human-Centric Priors in Diffusion Models for   Text-based Human Image Generation 
  * 2024-03-08  
  * Vanilla text-to-image diffusion models struggle with generating accurate human images, commonly resulting in imperfect anatomies such as unnatural postures or disproportionate limbs.Existing methods address this issue mostly by fine-tuning the model with extra images or adding additional controls -- human-centric priors such as pose or depth maps -- during the image generation phase. This paper explores the integration of these human-centric priors directly into the model fine-tuning stage, essentially eliminating the need for extra conditions at the inference stage. We realize this idea by proposing a human-centric alignment loss to strengthen human-related information from the textual prompts within the cross-attention maps. To ensure semantic detail richness and human structural accuracy during fine-tuning, we introduce scale-aware and step-wise constraints within the diffusion process, according to an in-depth analysis of the cross-attention layer. Extensive experiments show that our method largely improves over state-of-the-art text-to-image models to synthesize high-quality human images based on user-written prompts.

## Synthetic Privileged Information Enhances Medical Image Representation   Learning 
  * 2024-03-08  
  * Multimodal self-supervised representation learning has consistently proven to be a highly effective method in medical image analysis, offering strong task performance and producing biologically informed insights. However, these methods heavily rely on large, paired datasets, which is prohibitive for their use in scenarios where paired data does not exist, or there is only a small amount available. In contrast, image generation methods can work well on very small datasets, and can find mappings between unpaired datasets, meaning an effectively unlimited amount of paired synthetic data can be generated. In this work, we demonstrate that representation learning can be significantly improved by synthetically generating paired information, both compared to training on either single-modality (up to 4.4x error reduction) or authentic multi-modal paired datasets (up to 5.6x error reduction).

## Denoising Autoregressive Representation Learning 
  * 2024-03-08  
  * In this paper, we explore a new generative approach for learning visual representations. Our method, DARL, employs a decoder-only Transformer to predict image patches autoregressively. We find that training with Mean Squared Error (MSE) alone leads to strong representations. To enhance the image generation ability, we replace the MSE loss with the diffusion objective by using a denoising patch decoder. We show that the learned representation can be improved by using tailored noise schedules and longer training in larger models. Notably, the optimal schedule differs significantly from the typical ones used in standard image diffusion models. Overall, despite its simple architecture, DARL delivers performance remarkably close to state-of-the-art masked prediction models under the fine-tuning protocol. This marks an important step towards a unified model capable of both visual perception and generation, effectively combining the strengths of autoregressive and denoising diffusion models.

## ELLA: Equip Diffusion Models with LLM for Enhanced Semantic Alignment 
  * 2024-03-08  
  * Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in the domain of text-to-image generation. However, most widely used models still employ CLIP as their text encoder, which constrains their ability to comprehend dense prompts, encompassing multiple objects, detailed attributes, complex relationships, long-text alignment, etc. In this paper, we introduce an Efficient Large Language Model Adapter, termed ELLA, which equips text-to-image diffusion models with powerful Large Language Models (LLM) to enhance text alignment without training of either U-Net or LLM. To seamlessly bridge two pre-trained models, we investigate a range of semantic alignment connector designs and propose a novel module, the Timestep-Aware Semantic Connector (TSC), which dynamically extracts timestep-dependent conditions from LLM. Our approach adapts semantic features at different stages of the denoising process, assisting diffusion models in interpreting lengthy and intricate prompts over sampling timesteps. Additionally, ELLA can be readily incorporated with community models and tools to improve their prompt-following capabilities. To assess text-to-image models in dense prompt following, we introduce Dense Prompt Graph Benchmark (DPG-Bench), a challenging benchmark consisting of 1K dense prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of ELLA in dense prompt following compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly in multiple object compositions involving diverse attributes and relationships.

## Sora as an AGI World Model? A Complete Survey on Text-to-Video   Generation 
  * 2024-03-08  
  * Text-to-video generation marks a significant frontier in the rapidly evolving domain of generative AI, integrating advancements in text-to-image synthesis, video captioning, and text-guided editing. This survey critically examines the progression of text-to-video technologies, focusing on the shift from traditional generative models to the cutting-edge Sora model, highlighting developments in scalability and generalizability. Distinguishing our analysis from prior works, we offer an in-depth exploration of the technological frameworks and evolutionary pathways of these models. Additionally, we delve into practical applications and address ethical and technological challenges such as the inability to perform multiple entity handling, comprehend causal-effect learning, understand physical interaction, perceive object scaling and proportioning, and combat object hallucination which is also a long-standing problem in generative models. Our comprehensive discussion covers the topic of enablement of text-to-video generation models as human-assistive tools and world models, as well as eliciting model's shortcomings and summarizing future improvement direction that mainly centers around training datasets and evaluation metrics (both automatic and human-centered). Aimed at both newcomers and seasoned researchers, this survey seeks to catalyze further innovation and discussion in the growing field of text-to-video generation, paving the way for more reliable and practical generative artificial intelligence technologies.

## Evaluating Text-to-Image Generative Models: An Empirical Study on Human   Image Synthesis 
  * 2024-03-08  
  * In this paper, we present an empirical study introducing a nuanced evaluation framework for text-to-image (T2I) generative models, applied to human image synthesis. Our framework categorizes evaluations into two distinct groups: first, focusing on image qualities such as aesthetics and realism, and second, examining text conditions through concept coverage and fairness. We introduce an innovative aesthetic score prediction model that assesses the visual appeal of generated images and unveils the first dataset marked with low-quality regions in generated human images to facilitate automatic defect detection. Our exploration into concept coverage probes the model's effectiveness in interpreting and rendering text-based concepts accurately, while our analysis of fairness reveals biases in model outputs, with an emphasis on gender, race, and age. While our study is grounded in human imagery, this dual-faceted approach is designed with the flexibility to be applicable to other forms of image generation, enhancing our understanding of generative models and paving the way to the next generation of more sophisticated, contextually aware, and ethically attuned generative models. We will release our code, the data used for evaluating generative models and the dataset annotated with defective areas soon.

## CogView3: Finer and Faster Text-to-Image Generation via Relay Diffusion 
  * 2024-03-08  
  * Recent advancements in text-to-image generative systems have been largely driven by diffusion models. However, single-stage text-to-image diffusion models still face challenges, in terms of computational efficiency and the refinement of image details. To tackle the issue, we propose CogView3, an innovative cascaded framework that enhances the performance of text-to-image diffusion. CogView3 is the first model implementing relay diffusion in the realm of text-to-image generation, executing the task by first creating low-resolution images and subsequently applying relay-based super-resolution. This methodology not only results in competitive text-to-image outputs but also greatly reduces both training and inference costs. Our experimental results demonstrate that CogView3 outperforms SDXL, the current state-of-the-art open-source text-to-image diffusion model, by 77.0\% in human evaluations, all while requiring only about 1/2 of the inference time. The distilled variant of CogView3 achieves comparable performance while only utilizing 1/10 of the inference time by SDXL.

## Face2Diffusion for Fast and Editable Face Personalization 
  * 2024-03-08  
  * Face personalization aims to insert specific faces, taken from images, into pretrained text-to-image diffusion models. However, it is still challenging for previous methods to preserve both the identity similarity and editability due to overfitting to training samples. In this paper, we propose Face2Diffusion (F2D) for high-editability face personalization. The core idea behind F2D is that removing identity-irrelevant information from the training pipeline prevents the overfitting problem and improves editability of encoded faces. F2D consists of the following three novel components: 1) Multi-scale identity encoder provides well-disentangled identity features while keeping the benefits of multi-scale information, which improves the diversity of camera poses. 2) Expression guidance disentangles face expressions from identities and improves the controllability of face expressions. 3) Class-guided denoising regularization encourages models to learn how faces should be denoised, which boosts the text-alignment of backgrounds. Extensive experiments on the FaceForensics++ dataset and diverse prompts demonstrate our method greatly improves the trade-off between the identity- and text-fidelity compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

## Spectrum Translation for Refinement of Image Generation (STIG) Based on   Contrastive Learning and Spectral Filter Profile 
  * 2024-03-08  
  * Currently, image generation and synthesis have remarkably progressed with generative models. Despite photo-realistic results, intrinsic discrepancies are still observed in the frequency domain. The spectral discrepancy appeared not only in generative adversarial networks but in diffusion models. In this study, we propose a framework to effectively mitigate the disparity in frequency domain of the generated images to improve generative performance of both GAN and diffusion models. This is realized by spectrum translation for the refinement of image generation (STIG) based on contrastive learning. We adopt theoretical logic of frequency components in various generative networks. The key idea, here, is to refine the spectrum of the generated image via the concept of image-to-image translation and contrastive learning in terms of digital signal processing. We evaluate our framework across eight fake image datasets and various cutting-edge models to demonstrate the effectiveness of STIG. Our framework outperforms other cutting-edges showing significant decreases in FID and log frequency distance of spectrum. We further emphasize that STIG improves image quality by decreasing the spectral anomaly. Additionally, validation results present that the frequency-based deepfake detector confuses more in the case where fake spectrums are manipulated by STIG.

## Stealing Stable Diffusion Prior for Robust Monocular Depth Estimation 
  * 2024-03-08  
  * Monocular depth estimation is a crucial task in computer vision. While existing methods have shown impressive results under standard conditions, they often face challenges in reliably performing in scenarios such as low-light or rainy conditions due to the absence of diverse training data. This paper introduces a novel approach named Stealing Stable Diffusion (SSD) prior for robust monocular depth estimation. The approach addresses this limitation by utilizing stable diffusion to generate synthetic images that mimic challenging conditions. Additionally, a self-training mechanism is introduced to enhance the model's depth estimation capability in such challenging environments. To enhance the utilization of the stable diffusion prior further, the DINOv2 encoder is integrated into the depth model architecture, enabling the model to leverage rich semantic priors and improve its scene understanding. Furthermore, a teacher loss is introduced to guide the student models in acquiring meaningful knowledge independently, thus reducing their dependency on the teacher models. The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated on nuScenes and Oxford RobotCar, two challenging public datasets, with the results showing the efficacy of the method. Source code and weights are available at: https://github.com/hitcslj/SSD.

## DiffChat: Learning to Chat with Text-to-Image Synthesis Models for   Interactive Image Creation 
  * 2024-03-08  
  * We present DiffChat, a novel method to align Large Language Models (LLMs) to "chat" with prompt-as-input Text-to-Image Synthesis (TIS) models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) for interactive image creation. Given a raw prompt/image and a user-specified instruction, DiffChat can effectively make appropriate modifications and generate the target prompt, which can be leveraged to create the target image of high quality. To achieve this, we first collect an instruction-following prompt engineering dataset named InstructPE for the supervised training of DiffChat. Next, we propose a reinforcement learning framework with the feedback of three core criteria for image creation, i.e., aesthetics, user preference, and content integrity. It involves an action-space dynamic modification technique to obtain more relevant positive samples and harder negative samples during the off-policy sampling. Content integrity is also introduced into the value estimation function for further improvement of produced images. Our method can exhibit superior performance than baseline models and strong competitors based on both automatic and human evaluations, which fully demonstrates its effectiveness.

## StereoDiffusion: Training-Free Stereo Image Generation Using Latent   Diffusion Models 
  * 2024-03-08  
  * The demand for stereo images increases as manufacturers launch more XR devices. To meet this demand, we introduce StereoDiffusion, a method that, unlike traditional inpainting pipelines, is trainning free, remarkably straightforward to use, and it seamlessly integrates into the original Stable Diffusion model. Our method modifies the latent variable to provide an end-to-end, lightweight capability for fast generation of stereo image pairs, without the need for fine-tuning model weights or any post-processing of images. Using the original input to generate a left image and estimate a disparity map for it, we generate the latent vector for the right image through Stereo Pixel Shift operations, complemented by Symmetric Pixel Shift Masking Denoise and Self-Attention Layers Modification methods to align the right-side image with the left-side image. Moreover, our proposed method maintains a high standard of image quality throughout the stereo generation process, achieving state-of-the-art scores in various quantitative evaluations.

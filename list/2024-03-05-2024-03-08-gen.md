## ObjectCompose: Evaluating Resilience of Vision-Based Models on   Object-to-Background Compositional Changes 
  * 2024-03-07  
  * Given the large-scale multi-modal training of recent vision-based models and their generalization capabilities, understanding the extent of their robustness is critical for their real-world deployment. In this work, we evaluate the resilience of current vision-based models against diverse object-to-background context variations. The majority of robustness evaluation methods have introduced synthetic datasets to induce changes to object characteristics (viewpoints, scale, color) or utilized image transformation techniques (adversarial changes, common corruptions) on real images to simulate shifts in distributions. Recent works have explored leveraging large language models and diffusion models to generate changes in the background. However, these methods either lack in offering control over the changes to be made or distort the object semantics, making them unsuitable for the task. Our method, on the other hand, can induce diverse object-to-background changes while preserving the original semantics and appearance of the object. To achieve this goal, we harness the generative capabilities of text-to-image, image-to-text, and image-to-segment models to automatically generate a broad spectrum of object-to-background changes. We induce both natural and adversarial background changes by either modifying the textual prompts or optimizing the latents and textual embedding of text-to-image models. This allows us to quantify the role of background context in understanding the robustness and generalization of deep neural networks. We produce various versions of standard vision datasets (ImageNet, COCO), incorporating either diverse and realistic backgrounds into the images or introducing color, texture, and adversarial changes in the background. We conduct extensive experiment to analyze the robustness of vision-based models against object-to-background context variations across diverse tasks.

## PixArt-Σ: Weak-to-Strong Training of Diffusion Transformer for 4K   Text-to-Image Generation 
  * 2024-03-07  
  * In this paper, we introduce PixArt-\Sigma, a Diffusion Transformer model~(DiT) capable of directly generating images at 4K resolution. PixArt-\Sigma represents a significant advancement over its predecessor, PixArt-\alpha, offering images of markedly higher fidelity and improved alignment with text prompts. A key feature of PixArt-\Sigma is its training efficiency. Leveraging the foundational pre-training of PixArt-\alpha, it evolves from the `weaker' baseline to a `stronger' model via incorporating higher quality data, a process we term "weak-to-strong training". The advancements in PixArt-\Sigma are twofold: (1) High-Quality Training Data: PixArt-\Sigma incorporates superior-quality image data, paired with more precise and detailed image captions. (2) Efficient Token Compression: we propose a novel attention module within the DiT framework that compresses both keys and values, significantly improving efficiency and facilitating ultra-high-resolution image generation. Thanks to these improvements, PixArt-\Sigma achieves superior image quality and user prompt adherence capabilities with significantly smaller model size (0.6B parameters) than existing text-to-image diffusion models, such as SDXL (2.6B parameters) and SD Cascade (5.1B parameters). Moreover, PixArt-\Sigma's capability to generate 4K images supports the creation of high-resolution posters and wallpapers, efficiently bolstering the production of high-quality visual content in industries such as film and gaming.

## Pix2Gif: Motion-Guided Diffusion for GIF Generation 
  * 2024-03-07  
  * We present Pix2Gif, a motion-guided diffusion model for image-to-GIF (video) generation. We tackle this problem differently by formulating the task as an image translation problem steered by text and motion magnitude prompts, as shown in teaser fig. To ensure that the model adheres to motion guidance, we propose a new motion-guided warping module to spatially transform the features of the source image conditioned on the two types of prompts. Furthermore, we introduce a perceptual loss to ensure the transformed feature map remains within the same space as the target image, ensuring content consistency and coherence. In preparation for the model training, we meticulously curated data by extracting coherent image frames from the TGIF video-caption dataset, which provides rich information about the temporal changes of subjects. After pretraining, we apply our model in a zero-shot manner to a number of video datasets. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model -- it not only captures the semantic prompt from text but also the spatial ones from motion guidance. We train all our models using a single node of 16xV100 GPUs. Code, dataset and models are made public at: https://hiteshk03.github.io/Pix2Gif/.

## Discriminative Probing and Tuning for Text-to-Image Generation 
  * 2024-03-07  
  * Despite advancements in text-to-image generation (T2I), prior methods often face text-image misalignment problems such as relation confusion in generated images. Existing solutions involve cross-attention manipulation for better compositional understanding or integrating large language models for improved layout planning. However, the inherent alignment capabilities of T2I models are still inadequate. By reviewing the link between generative and discriminative modeling, we posit that T2I models' discriminative abilities may reflect their text-image alignment proficiency during generation. In this light, we advocate bolstering the discriminative abilities of T2I models to achieve more precise text-to-image alignment for generation. We present a discriminative adapter built on T2I models to probe their discriminative abilities on two representative tasks and leverage discriminative fine-tuning to improve their text-image alignment. As a bonus of the discriminative adapter, a self-correction mechanism can leverage discriminative gradients to better align generated images to text prompts during inference. Comprehensive evaluations across three benchmark datasets, including both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios, demonstrate our method's superior generation performance. Meanwhile, it achieves state-of-the-art discriminative performance on the two discriminative tasks compared to other generative models.

## Effectiveness Assessment of Recent Large Vision-Language Models 
  * 2024-03-07  
  * The advent of large vision-language models (LVLMs) represents a noteworthy advancement towards the pursuit of artificial general intelligence. However, the extent of their efficacy across both specialized and general tasks warrants further investigation. This article endeavors to evaluate the competency of popular LVLMs in specialized and general tasks, respectively, aiming to offer a comprehensive comprehension of these innovative methodologies. To gauge their efficacy in specialized tasks, we tailor a comprehensive testbed comprising three distinct scenarios: natural, healthcare, and industrial, encompassing six challenging tasks. These tasks include salient, camouflaged, and transparent object detection, as well as polyp and skin lesion detection, alongside industrial anomaly detection. We examine the performance of three recent open-source LVLMs -- MiniGPT-v2, LLaVA-1.5, and Shikra -- in the realm of visual recognition and localization. Moreover, we conduct empirical investigations utilizing the aforementioned models alongside GPT-4V, assessing their multi-modal understanding capacities in general tasks such as object counting, absurd question answering, affordance reasoning, attribute recognition, and spatial relation reasoning. Our investigations reveal that these models demonstrate limited proficiency not only in specialized tasks but also in general tasks. We delve deeper into this inadequacy and suggest several potential factors, including limited cognition in specialized tasks, object hallucination, text-to-image interference, and decreased robustness in complex problems. We hope this study would provide valuable insights for the future development of LVLMs, augmenting their power in coping with both general and specialized applications.

## MedM2G: Unifying Medical Multi-Modal Generation via Cross-Guided   Diffusion with Visual Invariant 
  * 2024-03-07  
  * Medical generative models, acknowledged for their high-quality sample generation ability, have accelerated the fast growth of medical applications. However, recent works concentrate on separate medical generation models for distinct medical tasks and are restricted to inadequate medical multi-modal knowledge, constraining medical comprehensive diagnosis. In this paper, we propose MedM2G, a Medical Multi-Modal Generative framework, with the key innovation to align, extract, and generate medical multi-modal within a unified model. Extending beyond single or two medical modalities, we efficiently align medical multi-modal through the central alignment approach in the unified space. Significantly, our framework extracts valuable clinical knowledge by preserving the medical visual invariant of each imaging modal, thereby enhancing specific medical information for multi-modal generation. By conditioning the adaptive cross-guided parameters into the multi-flow diffusion framework, our model promotes flexible interactions among medical multi-modal for generation. MedM2G is the first medical generative model that unifies medical generation tasks of text-to-image, image-to-text, and unified generation of medical modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray). It performs 5 medical generation tasks across 10 datasets, consistently outperforming various state-of-the-art works.

## Controllable Generation with Text-to-Image Diffusion Models: A Survey 
  * 2024-03-07  
  * In the rapidly advancing realm of visual generation, diffusion models have revolutionized the landscape, marking a significant shift in capabilities with their impressive text-guided generative functions. However, relying solely on text for conditioning these models does not fully cater to the varied and complex requirements of different applications and scenarios. Acknowledging this shortfall, a variety of studies aim to control pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models to support novel conditions. In this survey, we undertake a thorough review of the literature on controllable generation with T2I diffusion models, covering both the theoretical foundations and practical advancements in this domain. Our review begins with a brief introduction to the basics of denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and widely used T2I diffusion models. We then reveal the controlling mechanisms of diffusion models, theoretically analyzing how novel conditions are introduced into the denoising process for conditional generation. Additionally, we offer a detailed overview of research in this area, organizing it into distinct categories from the condition perspective: generation with specific conditions, generation with multiple conditions, and universal controllable generation. For an exhaustive list of the controllable generation literature surveyed, please refer to our curated repository at \url{https://github.com/PRIV-Creation/Awesome-Controllable-T2I-Diffusion-Models}.

## DNAct: Diffusion Guided Multi-Task 3D Policy Learning 
  * 2024-03-07  
  * This paper presents DNAct, a language-conditioned multi-task policy framework that integrates neural rendering pre-training and diffusion training to enforce multi-modality learning in action sequence spaces. To learn a generalizable multi-task policy with few demonstrations, the pre-training phase of DNAct leverages neural rendering to distill 2D semantic features from foundation models such as Stable Diffusion to a 3D space, which provides a comprehensive semantic understanding regarding the scene. Consequently, it allows various applications to challenging robotic tasks requiring rich 3D semantics and accurate geometry. Furthermore, we introduce a novel approach utilizing diffusion training to learn a vision and language feature that encapsulates the inherent multi-modality in the multi-task demonstrations. By reconstructing the action sequences from different tasks via the diffusion process, the model is capable of distinguishing different modalities and thus improving the robustness and the generalizability of the learned representation. DNAct significantly surpasses SOTA NeRF-based multi-task manipulation approaches with over 30% improvement in success rate. Project website: dnact.github.io.

## PromptCharm: Text-to-Image Generation through Multi-modal Prompting and   Refinement 
  * 2024-03-06  
  * The recent advancements in Generative AI have significantly advanced the field of text-to-image generation. The state-of-the-art text-to-image model, Stable Diffusion, is now capable of synthesizing high-quality images with a strong sense of aesthetics. Crafting text prompts that align with the model's interpretation and the user's intent thus becomes crucial. However, prompting remains challenging for novice users due to the complexity of the stable diffusion model and the non-trivial efforts required for iteratively editing and refining the text prompts. To address these challenges, we propose PromptCharm, a mixed-initiative system that facilitates text-to-image creation through multi-modal prompt engineering and refinement. To assist novice users in prompting, PromptCharm first automatically refines and optimizes the user's initial prompt. Furthermore, PromptCharm supports the user in exploring and selecting different image styles within a large database. To assist users in effectively refining their prompts and images, PromptCharm renders model explanations by visualizing the model's attention values. If the user notices any unsatisfactory areas in the generated images, they can further refine the images through model attention adjustment or image inpainting within the rich feedback loop of PromptCharm. To evaluate the effectiveness and usability of PromptCharm, we conducted a controlled user study with 12 participants and an exploratory user study with another 12 participants. These two studies show that participants using PromptCharm were able to create images with higher quality and better aligned with the user's expectations compared with using two variants of PromptCharm that lacked interaction or visualization support.

## Unifying Generation and Compression: Ultra-low bitrate Image Coding Via   Multi-stage Transformer 
  * 2024-03-06  
  * Recent progress in generative compression technology has significantly improved the perceptual quality of compressed data. However, these advancements primarily focus on producing high-frequency details, often overlooking the ability of generative models to capture the prior distribution of image content, thus impeding further bitrate reduction in extreme compression scenarios (<0.05 bpp). Motivated by the capabilities of predictive language models for lossless compression, this paper introduces a novel Unified Image Generation-Compression (UIGC) paradigm, merging the processes of generation and compression. A key feature of the UIGC framework is the adoption of vector-quantized (VQ) image models for tokenization, alongside a multi-stage transformer designed to exploit spatial contextual information for modeling the prior distribution. As such, the dual-purpose framework effectively utilizes the learned prior for entropy estimation and assists in the regeneration of lost tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed UIGC framework over existing codecs in perceptual quality and human perception, particularly in ultra-low bitrate scenarios (<=0.03 bpp), pioneering a new direction in generative compression.

## NoiseCollage: A Layout-Aware Text-to-Image Diffusion Model Based on   Noise Cropping and Merging 
  * 2024-03-06  
  * Layout-aware text-to-image generation is a task to generate multi-object images that reflect layout conditions in addition to text conditions. The current layout-aware text-to-image diffusion models still have several issues, including mismatches between the text and layout conditions and quality degradation of generated images. This paper proposes a novel layout-aware text-to-image diffusion model called NoiseCollage to tackle these issues. During the denoising process, NoiseCollage independently estimates noises for individual objects and then crops and merges them into a single noise. This operation helps avoid condition mismatches; in other words, it can put the right objects in the right places. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that NoiseCollage outperforms several state-of-the-art models. These successful results indicate that the crop-and-merge operation of noises is a reasonable strategy to control image generation. We also show that NoiseCollage can be integrated with ControlNet to use edges, sketches, and pose skeletons as additional conditions. Experimental results show that this integration boosts the layout accuracy of ControlNet. The code is available at https://github.com/univ-esuty/noisecollage.

## DLP-GAN: learning to draw modern Chinese landscape photos with   generative adversarial network 
  * 2024-03-06  
  * Chinese landscape painting has a unique and artistic style, and its drawing technique is highly abstract in both the use of color and the realistic representation of objects. Previous methods focus on transferring from modern photos to ancient ink paintings. However, little attention has been paid to translating landscape paintings into modern photos. To solve such problems, in this paper, we (1) propose DLP-GAN (Draw Modern Chinese Landscape Photos with Generative Adversarial Network), an unsupervised cross-domain image translation framework with a novel asymmetric cycle mapping, and (2) introduce a generator based on a dense-fusion module to match different translation directions. Moreover, a dual-consistency loss is proposed to balance the realism and abstraction of model painting. In this way, our model can draw landscape photos and sketches in the modern sense. Finally, based on our collection of modern landscape and sketch datasets, we compare the images generated by our model with other benchmarks. Extensive experiments including user studies show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

## Towards Understanding Cross and Self-Attention in Stable Diffusion for   Text-Guided Image Editing 
  * 2024-03-06  
  * Deep Text-to-Image Synthesis (TIS) models such as Stable Diffusion have recently gained significant popularity for creative Text-to-image generation. Yet, for domain-specific scenarios, tuning-free Text-guided Image Editing (TIE) is of greater importance for application developers, which modify objects or object properties in images by manipulating feature components in attention layers during the generation process. However, little is known about what semantic meanings these attention layers have learned and which parts of the attention maps contribute to the success of image editing. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth probing analysis and demonstrate that cross-attention maps in Stable Diffusion often contain object attribution information that can result in editing failures. In contrast, self-attention maps play a crucial role in preserving the geometric and shape details of the source image during the transformation to the target image. Our analysis offers valuable insights into understanding cross and self-attention maps in diffusion models. Moreover, based on our findings, we simplify popular image editing methods and propose a more straightforward yet more stable and efficient tuning-free procedure that only modifies self-attention maps of the specified attention layers during the denoising process. Experimental results show that our simplified method consistently surpasses the performance of popular approaches on multiple datasets.

## Scaling Rectified Flow Transformers for High-Resolution Image Synthesis 
  * 2024-03-05  
  * Diffusion models create data from noise by inverting the forward paths of data towards noise and have emerged as a powerful generative modeling technique for high-dimensional, perceptual data such as images and videos. Rectified flow is a recent generative model formulation that connects data and noise in a straight line. Despite its better theoretical properties and conceptual simplicity, it is not yet decisively established as standard practice. In this work, we improve existing noise sampling techniques for training rectified flow models by biasing them towards perceptually relevant scales. Through a large-scale study, we demonstrate the superior performance of this approach compared to established diffusion formulations for high-resolution text-to-image synthesis. Additionally, we present a novel transformer-based architecture for text-to-image generation that uses separate weights for the two modalities and enables a bidirectional flow of information between image and text tokens, improving text comprehension, typography, and human preference ratings. We demonstrate that this architecture follows predictable scaling trends and correlates lower validation loss to improved text-to-image synthesis as measured by various metrics and human evaluations. Our largest models outperform state-of-the-art models, and we will make our experimental data, code, and model weights publicly available.

## Behavior Generation with Latent Actions 
  * 2024-03-05  
  * Generative modeling of complex behaviors from labeled datasets has been a longstanding problem in decision making. Unlike language or image generation, decision making requires modeling actions - continuous-valued vectors that are multimodal in their distribution, potentially drawn from uncurated sources, where generation errors can compound in sequential prediction. A recent class of models called Behavior Transformers (BeT) addresses this by discretizing actions using k-means clustering to capture different modes. However, k-means struggles to scale for high-dimensional action spaces or long sequences, and lacks gradient information, and thus BeT suffers in modeling long-range actions. In this work, we present Vector-Quantized Behavior Transformer (VQ-BeT), a versatile model for behavior generation that handles multimodal action prediction, conditional generation, and partial observations. VQ-BeT augments BeT by tokenizing continuous actions with a hierarchical vector quantization module. Across seven environments including simulated manipulation, autonomous driving, and robotics, VQ-BeT improves on state-of-the-art models such as BeT and Diffusion Policies. Importantly, we demonstrate VQ-BeT's improved ability to capture behavior modes while accelerating inference speed 5x over Diffusion Policies. Videos and code can be found https://sjlee.cc/vq-bet

## Tuning-Free Noise Rectification for High Fidelity Image-to-Video   Generation 
  * 2024-03-05  
  * Image-to-video (I2V) generation tasks always suffer from keeping high fidelity in the open domains. Traditional image animation techniques primarily focus on specific domains such as faces or human poses, making them difficult to generalize to open domains. Several recent I2V frameworks based on diffusion models can generate dynamic content for open domain images but fail to maintain fidelity. We found that two main factors of low fidelity are the loss of image details and the noise prediction biases during the denoising process. To this end, we propose an effective method that can be applied to mainstream video diffusion models. This method achieves high fidelity based on supplementing more precise image information and noise rectification. Specifically, given a specified image, our method first adds noise to the input image latent to keep more details, then denoises the noisy latent with proper rectification to alleviate the noise prediction biases. Our method is tuning-free and plug-and-play. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving the fidelity of generated videos.

## Bias in Generative AI 
  * 2024-03-05  
  * This study analyzed images generated by three popular generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools - Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and DALLE 2 - representing various occupations to investigate potential bias in AI generators. Our analysis revealed two overarching areas of concern in these AI generators, including (1) systematic gender and racial biases, and (2) subtle biases in facial expressions and appearances. Firstly, we found that all three AI generators exhibited bias against women and African Americans. Moreover, we found that the evident gender and racial biases uncovered in our analysis were even more pronounced than the status quo when compared to labor force statistics or Google images, intensifying the harmful biases we are actively striving to rectify in our society. Secondly, our study uncovered more nuanced prejudices in the portrayal of emotions and appearances. For example, women were depicted as younger with more smiles and happiness, while men were depicted as older with more neutral expressions and anger, posing a risk that generative AI models may unintentionally depict women as more submissive and less competent than men. Such nuanced biases, by their less overt nature, might be more problematic as they can permeate perceptions unconsciously and may be more difficult to rectify. Although the extent of bias varied depending on the model, the direction of bias remained consistent in both commercial and open-source AI generators. As these tools become commonplace, our study highlights the urgency to identify and mitigate various biases in generative AI, reinforcing the commitment to ensuring that AI technologies benefit all of humanity for a more inclusive future.

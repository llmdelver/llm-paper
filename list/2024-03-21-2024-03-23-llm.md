## MathVerse: Does Your Multi-modal LLM Truly See the Diagrams in Visual   Math Problems? 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * The remarkable progress of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has garnered unparalleled attention, due to their superior performance in visual contexts. However, their capabilities in visual math problem-solving remain insufficiently evaluated and understood. We investigate current benchmarks to incorporate excessive visual content within textual questions, which potentially assist MLLMs in deducing answers without truly interpreting the input diagrams. To this end, we introduce MathVerse, an all-around visual math benchmark designed for an equitable and in-depth evaluation of MLLMs. We meticulously collect 2,612 high-quality, multi-subject math problems with diagrams from publicly available sources. Each problem is then transformed by human annotators into six distinct versions, each offering varying degrees of information content in multi-modality, contributing to 15K test samples in total. This approach allows MathVerse to comprehensively assess whether and how much MLLMs can truly understand the visual diagrams for mathematical reasoning. In addition, we propose a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation strategy for a fine-grained assessment of the output answers. Rather than naively judging True or False, we employ GPT-4(V) to adaptively extract crucial reasoning steps, and then score each step with detailed error analysis, which can reveal the intermediate CoT reasoning quality by MLLMs. We hope the MathVerse benchmark may provide unique insights to guide the future development of MLLMs. Project page: https://mathverse-cuhk.github.io

## Language Repository for Long Video Understanding 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * Language has become a prominent modality in computer vision with the rise of multi-modal LLMs. Despite supporting long context-lengths, their effectiveness in handling long-term information gradually declines with input length. This becomes critical, especially in applications such as long-form video understanding. In this paper, we introduce a Language Repository (LangRepo) for LLMs, that maintains concise and structured information as an interpretable (i.e., all-textual) representation. Our repository is updated iteratively based on multi-scale video chunks. We introduce write and read operations that focus on pruning redundancies in text, and extracting information at various temporal scales. The proposed framework is evaluated on zero-shot visual question-answering benchmarks including EgoSchema, NExT-QA, IntentQA and NExT-GQA, showing state-of-the-art performance at its scale. Our code is available at https://github.com/kkahatapitiya/LangRepo.

## PSALM: Pixelwise SegmentAtion with Large Multi-Modal Model 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * PSALM is a powerful extension of the Large Multi-modal Model (LMM) to address the segmentation task challenges. To overcome the limitation of the LMM being limited to textual output, PSALM incorporates a mask decoder and a well-designed input schema to handle a variety of segmentation tasks. This schema includes images, task instructions, conditional prompts, and mask tokens, which enable the model to generate and classify segmentation masks effectively. The flexible design of PSALM supports joint training across multiple datasets and tasks, leading to improved performance and task generalization. PSALM achieves superior results on several benchmarks, such as RefCOCO/RefCOCO+/RefCOCOg, COCO Panoptic Segmentation, and COCO-Interactive, and further exhibits zero-shot capabilities on unseen tasks, such as open-vocabulary segmentation, generalized referring expression segmentation and video object segmentation, making a significant step towards a GPT moment in computer vision. Through extensive experiments, PSALM demonstrates its potential to transform the domain of image segmentation, leveraging the robust visual understanding capabilities of LMMs as seen in natural language processing. Code and models are available at https://github.com/zamling/PSALM.

## ReAct Meets ActRe: Autonomous Annotations of Agent Trajectories for   Contrastive Self-Training 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * Language agents have demonstrated autonomous decision-making abilities by reasoning with foundation models. Recently, efforts have been made to train language agents for performance improvement, with multi-step reasoning and action trajectories as the training data. However, collecting such trajectories still requires considerable human effort, by either artificial annotations or implementations of diverse prompting frameworks. In this work, we propose A$^3$T, a framework that enables the Autonomous Annotation of Agent Trajectories in the style of ReAct. The central role is an ActRe prompting agent, which explains the reason for an arbitrary action. When randomly sampling an external action, the ReAct-style agent could query the ActRe agent with the action to obtain its textual rationales. Novel trajectories are then synthesized by prepending the posterior reasoning from ActRe to the sampled action. In this way, the ReAct-style agent executes multiple trajectories for the failed tasks, and selects the successful ones to supplement its failed trajectory for contrastive self-training. Realized by policy gradient methods with binarized rewards, the contrastive self-training with accumulated trajectories facilitates a closed loop for multiple rounds of language agent self-improvement. We conduct experiments using QLoRA fine-tuning with the open-sourced Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2. In AlfWorld, the agent trained with A$^3$T obtains a 1-shot success rate of 96%, and 100% success with 4 iterative rounds. In WebShop, the 1-shot performance of the A$^3$T agent matches human average, and 4 rounds of iterative refinement lead to the performance approaching human experts. A$^3$T agents significantly outperform existing techniques, including prompting with GPT-4, advanced agent frameworks, and fully fine-tuned LLMs.

## Large Language Models for Multi-Choice Question Classification of   Medical Subjects 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * The aim of this paper is to evaluate whether large language models trained on multi-choice question data can be used to discriminate between medical subjects. This is an important and challenging task for automatic question answering. To achieve this goal, we train deep neural networks for multi-class classification of questions into the inferred medical subjects. Using our Multi-Question (MQ) Sequence-BERT method, we outperform the state-of-the-art results on the MedMCQA dataset with an accuracy of 0.68 and 0.60 on their development and test sets, respectively. In this sense, we show the capability of AI and LLMs in particular for multi-classification tasks in the Healthcare domain.

## RAmBLA: A Framework for Evaluating the Reliability of LLMs as Assistants   in the Biomedical Domain 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly support applications in a wide range of domains, some with potential high societal impact such as biomedicine, yet their reliability in realistic use cases is under-researched. In this work we introduce the Reliability AssesMent for Biomedical LLM Assistants (RAmBLA) framework and evaluate whether four state-of-the-art foundation LLMs can serve as reliable assistants in the biomedical domain. We identify prompt robustness, high recall, and a lack of hallucinations as necessary criteria for this use case. We design shortform tasks and tasks requiring LLM freeform responses mimicking real-world user interactions. We evaluate LLM performance using semantic similarity with a ground truth response, through an evaluator LLM.

## A Chain-of-Thought Prompting Approach with LLMs for Evaluating Students'   Formative Assessment Responses in Science 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to score and explain short-answer assessments in K-12 science. While existing methods can score more structured math and computer science assessments, they often do not provide explanations for the scores. Our study focuses on employing GPT-4 for automated assessment in middle school Earth Science, combining few-shot and active learning with chain-of-thought reasoning. Using a human-in-the-loop approach, we successfully score and provide meaningful explanations for formative assessment responses. A systematic analysis of our method's pros and cons sheds light on the potential for human-in-the-loop techniques to enhance automated grading for open-ended science assessments.

## The Era of Semantic Decoding 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * Recent work demonstrated great promise in the idea of orchestrating collaborations between LLMs, human input, and various tools to address the inherent limitations of LLMs. We propose a novel perspective called semantic decoding, which frames these collaborative processes as optimization procedures in semantic space. Specifically, we conceptualize LLMs as semantic processors that manipulate meaningful pieces of information that we call semantic tokens (known thoughts). LLMs are among a large pool of other semantic processors, including humans and tools, such as search engines or code executors. Collectively, semantic processors engage in dynamic exchanges of semantic tokens to progressively construct high-utility outputs. We refer to these orchestrated interactions among semantic processors, optimizing and searching in semantic space, as semantic decoding algorithms. This concept draws a direct parallel to the well-studied problem of syntactic decoding, which involves crafting algorithms to best exploit auto-regressive language models for extracting high-utility sequences of syntactic tokens. By focusing on the semantic level and disregarding syntactic details, we gain a fresh perspective on the engineering of AI systems, enabling us to imagine systems with much greater complexity and capabilities. In this position paper, we formalize the transition from syntactic to semantic tokens as well as the analogy between syntactic and semantic decoding. Subsequently, we explore the possibilities of optimizing within the space of semantic tokens via semantic decoding algorithms. We conclude with a list of research opportunities and questions arising from this fresh perspective. The semantic decoding perspective offers a powerful abstraction for search and optimization directly in the space of meaningful concepts, with semantic tokens as the fundamental units of a new type of computation.

## EDT: Improving Large Language Models' Generation by Entropy-based   Dynamic Temperature Sampling 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across a wide range of downstream language tasks. Temperature sampling is a commonly used decoding strategy for LLMs' generation process. However, a fixed temperature parameter is used in most cases, which may not always be an optimal choice for balancing generation quality and diversity. In this paper, we propose an effective Entropy-based Dynamic Temperature (EDT) Sampling method, to achieve a more balanced performance in terms of both generation quality and diversity by dynamically selecting the temperature parameter. Additionally, we also show model performance and comprehensive analyses for 4 different generation benchmarks. Our experiments show that EDT significantly outperforms the existing strategies across different tasks.

## Detoxifying Large Language Models via Knowledge Editing 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * This paper investigates using knowledge editing techniques to detoxify Large Language Models (LLMs). We construct a benchmark, SafeEdit, which covers nine unsafe categories with various powerful attack prompts and equips comprehensive metrics for systematic evaluation. We conduct experiments to compare knowledge editing approaches with previous baselines, indicating that knowledge editing has the potential to efficiently detoxify LLMs with limited impact on general performance. Then, we propose a simple yet effective baseline, dubbed Detoxifying with Intraoperative Neural Monitoring (DINM), to diminish the toxicity of LLMs within a few tuning steps via only one instance. We further provide an in-depth analysis of the internal mechanism for various detoxify approaches, demonstrating that previous methods like SFT and DPO may merely suppress the activations of toxic parameters, while DINM mitigates the toxicity of the toxic parameters to a certain extent, making permanent adjustments. We hope that these insights could shed light on future work of developing detoxifying approaches and the underlying knowledge mechanisms of LLMs. Code and benchmark are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit.

## ChatGPT Alternative Solutions: Large Language Models Survey 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * In recent times, the grandeur of Large Language Models (LLMs) has not only shone in the realm of natural language processing but has also cast its brilliance across a vast array of applications. This remarkable display of LLM capabilities has ignited a surge in research contributions within this domain, spanning a diverse spectrum of topics. These contributions encompass advancements in neural network architecture, context length enhancements, model alignment, training datasets, benchmarking, efficiency improvements, and more. Recent years have witnessed a dynamic synergy between academia and industry, propelling the field of LLM research to new heights. A notable milestone in this journey is the introduction of ChatGPT, a powerful AI chatbot grounded in LLMs, which has garnered widespread societal attention. The evolving technology of LLMs has begun to reshape the landscape of the entire AI community, promising a revolutionary shift in the way we create and employ AI algorithms. Given this swift-paced technical evolution, our survey embarks on a journey to encapsulate the recent strides made in the world of LLMs. Through an exploration of the background, key discoveries, and prevailing methodologies, we offer an up-to-the-minute review of the literature. By examining multiple LLM models, our paper not only presents a comprehensive overview but also charts a course that identifies existing challenges and points toward potential future research trajectories. This survey furnishes a well-rounded perspective on the current state of generative AI, shedding light on opportunities for further exploration, enhancement, and innovation.

## Towards Single-System Illusion in Software-Defined Vehicles --   Automated, AI-Powered Workflow 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * We propose a novel model- and feature-based approach to development of vehicle software systems, where the end architecture is not explicitly defined. Instead, it emerges from an iterative process of search and optimization given certain constraints, requirements and hardware architecture, while retaining the property of single-system illusion, where applications run in a logically uniform environment. One of the key points of the presented approach is the inclusion of modern generative AI, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), in the loop. With the recent advances in the field, we expect that the LLMs will be able to assist in processing of requirements, generation of formal system models, as well as generation of software deployment specification and test code. The resulting pipeline is automated to a large extent, with feedback being generated at each step.

## A Multimodal Approach to Device-Directed Speech Detection with Large   Language Models 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * Interactions with virtual assistants typically start with a predefined trigger phrase followed by the user command. To make interactions with the assistant more intuitive, we explore whether it is feasible to drop the requirement that users must begin each command with a trigger phrase. We explore this task in three ways: First, we train classifiers using only acoustic information obtained from the audio waveform. Second, we take the decoder outputs of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, such as 1-best hypotheses, as input features to a large language model (LLM). Finally, we explore a multimodal system that combines acoustic and lexical features, as well as ASR decoder signals in an LLM. Using multimodal information yields relative equal-error-rate improvements over text-only and audio-only models of up to 39% and 61%. Increasing the size of the LLM and training with low-rank adaption leads to further relative EER reductions of up to 18% on our dataset.

## Locating and Mitigating Gender Bias in Large Language Models 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * Large language models(LLM) are pre-trained on extensive corpora to learn facts and human cognition which contain human preferences. However, this process can inadvertently lead to these models acquiring biases and stereotypes prevalent in society. Prior research has typically tackled the issue of bias through a one-dimensional perspective, concentrating either on locating or mitigating it. This limited perspective has created obstacles in facilitating research on bias to synergistically complement and progressively build upon one another. In this study, we integrate the processes of locating and mitigating bias within a unified framework. Initially, we use causal mediation analysis to trace the causal effects of different components' activation within a large language model. Building on this, we propose the LSDM (Least Square Debias Method), a knowledge-editing based method for mitigating gender bias in occupational pronouns, and compare it against two baselines on three gender bias datasets and seven knowledge competency test datasets. The experimental results indicate that the primary contributors to gender bias are the bottom MLP modules acting on the last token of occupational pronouns and the top attention module acting on the final word in the sentence. Furthermore, LSDM mitigates gender bias in the model more effectively than the other baselines, while fully preserving the model's capabilities in all other aspects.

## Adaptive-RAG: Learning to Adapt Retrieval-Augmented Large Language   Models through Question Complexity 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models (LLMs), which incorporate the non-parametric knowledge from external knowledge bases into LLMs, have emerged as a promising approach to enhancing response accuracy in several tasks, such as Question-Answering (QA). However, even though there are various approaches dealing with queries of different complexities, they either handle simple queries with unnecessary computational overhead or fail to adequately address complex multi-step queries; yet, not all user requests fall into only one of the simple or complex categories. In this work, we propose a novel adaptive QA framework, that can dynamically select the most suitable strategy for (retrieval-augmented) LLMs from the simplest to the most sophisticated ones based on the query complexity. Also, this selection process is operationalized with a classifier, which is a smaller LM trained to predict the complexity level of incoming queries with automatically collected labels, obtained from actual predicted outcomes of models and inherent inductive biases in datasets. This approach offers a balanced strategy, seamlessly adapting between the iterative and single-step retrieval-augmented LLMs, as well as the no-retrieval methods, in response to a range of query complexities. We validate our model on a set of open-domain QA datasets, covering multiple query complexities, and show that ours enhances the overall efficiency and accuracy of QA systems, compared to relevant baselines including the adaptive retrieval approaches. Code is available at: https://github.com/starsuzi/Adaptive-RAG.

## Building Accurate Translation-Tailored LLMs with Language Aware   Instruction Tuning 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * Translation-tailored Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable translation capabilities, even competing with supervised-trained commercial translation systems. However, off-target translation remains an unsolved problem, especially for low-resource languages, hindering us from developing accurate LLMs-based translation models. To mitigate the off-target translation problem and enhance the performance of LLMs on translation, recent works have either designed advanced prompting strategies to highlight the functionality of translation instructions or exploited the in-context learning ability of LLMs by feeding few-shot demonstrations. However, these methods essentially do not improve LLM's ability to follow translation instructions, especially the language direction information. In this work, we design a two-stage fine-tuning algorithm to improve the instruction-following ability (especially the translation direction) of LLMs. Specifically, we first tune LLMs with the maximum likelihood estimation loss on the translation dataset to elicit the basic translation capabilities. In the second stage, we construct instruction-conflicting samples by randomly replacing the translation directions with a wrong one within the instruction, and then introduce an extra unlikelihood loss to learn those samples. Experiments on IWSLT and WMT benchmarks upon the LLaMA model spanning 16 zero-shot directions show that, compared to the competitive baseline -- translation-finetuned LLama, our method could effectively reduce the off-target translation ratio (averagely -53.3\%), thus improving translation quality with average +5.7 SacreBLEU and +16.4 BLEURT. Analysis shows that our method could preserve the model's general task performance on AlpacaEval. Code and models will be released at \url{https://github.com/alphadl/LanguageAware_Tuning}.

## From Large to Tiny: Distilling and Refining Mathematical Expertise for   Math Word Problems with Weakly Supervision 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * Addressing the challenge of high annotation costs in solving Math Word Problems (MWPs) through full supervision with intermediate equations, recent works have proposed weakly supervised task settings that rely solely on the final answer as a supervised signal. Existing leading approaches typically employ various search techniques to infer intermediate equations, but cannot ensure their semantic consistency with natural language descriptions. The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT has opened up new possibilities for addressing MWPs directly. However, the computational demands of LLMs make them less than ideal for use in settings where resources are tight. In light of these challenges, we introduce an innovative two-stage framework that adeptly transfers mathematical Expertise from large to tiny language models. In \emph{Distillation Stage}, we propose a series of extraction processes that satisfy the properties of MWPs to distill mathematical knowledge from LLMs to construct problem-equation pairs required for supervised training. In \emph{Refinement Stage}, Due to Knowledge distilling method cannot guarantee the full utilization of all data, we further utilize the unsuccessfully searched data effectively by Knowledge Refine method. Finally, We train a small model using distilled data generated through two-stage methods. As our method fully leverages the semantic understanding capabilities during the searching 'problem-equation' pair, it demonstrates significantly improved performance on the Math23K and Weak12K datasets compared to existing small model methods, while maintaining a much lower computational cost than ChatGPT.

## FIT-RAG: Black-Box RAG with Factual Information and Token Reduction 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * Due to the extraordinarily large number of parameters, fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) to update long-tail or out-of-date knowledge is impractical in lots of applications. To avoid fine-tuning, we can alternatively treat a LLM as a black-box (i.e., freeze the parameters of the LLM) and augment it with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, namely black-box RAG. Recently, black-box RAG has achieved success in knowledge-intensive tasks and has gained much attention. Existing black-box RAG methods typically fine-tune the retriever to cater to LLMs' preferences and concatenate all the retrieved documents as the input, which suffers from two issues: (1) Ignorance of Factual Information. The LLM preferred documents may not contain the factual information for the given question, which can mislead the retriever and hurt the effectiveness of black-box RAG; (2) Waste of Tokens. Simply concatenating all the retrieved documents brings large amounts of unnecessary tokens for LLMs, which degenerates the efficiency of black-box RAG. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel black-box RAG framework which utilizes the factual information in the retrieval and reduces the number of tokens for augmentation, dubbed FIT-RAG. FIT-RAG utilizes the factual information by constructing a bi-label document scorer. Besides, it reduces the tokens by introducing a self-knowledge recognizer and a sub-document-level token reducer. FIT-RAG achieves both superior effectiveness and efficiency, which is validated by extensive experiments across three open-domain question-answering datasets: TriviaQA, NQ and PopQA. FIT-RAG can improve the answering accuracy of Llama2-13B-Chat by 14.3\% on TriviaQA, 19.9\% on NQ and 27.5\% on PopQA, respectively. Furthermore, it can save approximately half of the tokens on average across the three datasets.

## WikiFactDiff: A Large, Realistic, and Temporally Adaptable Dataset for   Atomic Factual Knowledge Update in Causal Language Models 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * The factuality of large language model (LLMs) tends to decay over time since events posterior to their training are "unknown" to them. One way to keep models up-to-date could be factual update: the task of inserting, replacing, or removing certain simple (atomic) facts within the model. To study this task, we present WikiFactDiff, a dataset that describes the evolution of factual knowledge between two dates as a collection of simple facts divided into three categories: new, obsolete, and static. We describe several update scenarios arising from various combinations of these three types of basic update. The facts are represented by subject-relation-object triples; indeed, WikiFactDiff was constructed by comparing the state of the Wikidata knowledge base at 4 January 2021 and 27 February 2023. Those fact are accompanied by verbalization templates and cloze tests that enable running update algorithms and their evaluation metrics. Contrary to other datasets, such as zsRE and CounterFact, WikiFactDiff constitutes a realistic update setting that involves various update scenarios, including replacements, archival, and new entity insertions. We also present an evaluation of existing update algorithms on WikiFactDiff.

## Less but Better: Enabling Generalized Zero-shot Learning Towards Unseen   Domains by Intrinsic Learning from Redundant LLM Semantics 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * Generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) focuses on recognizing seen and unseen classes against domain shift problem (DSP) where data of unseen classes may be misclassified as seen classes. However, existing GZSL is still limited to seen domains. In the current work, we pioneer cross-domain GZSL (CDGZSL) which addresses GZSL towards unseen domains. Different from existing GZSL methods which alleviate DSP by generating features of unseen classes with semantics, CDGZSL needs to construct a common feature space across domains and acquire the corresponding intrinsic semantics shared among domains to transfer from seen to unseen domains. Considering the information asymmetry problem caused by redundant class semantics annotated with large language models (LLMs), we present Meta Domain Alignment Semantic Refinement (MDASR). Technically, MDASR consists of two parts: Inter-class Similarity Alignment (ISA), which eliminates the non-intrinsic semantics not shared across all domains under the guidance of inter-class feature relationships, and Unseen-class Meta Generation (UMG), which preserves intrinsic semantics to maintain connectivity between seen and unseen classes by simulating feature generation. MDASR effectively aligns the redundant semantic space with the common feature space, mitigating the information asymmetry in CDGZSL. The effectiveness of MDASR is demonstrated on the Office-Home and Mini-DomainNet, and we have shared the LLM-based semantics for these datasets as the benchmark.

## Exploring the Potential of Large Language Models in Graph Generation 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * Large language models (LLMs) have achieved great success in many fields, and recent works have studied exploring LLMs for graph discriminative tasks such as node classification. However, the abilities of LLMs for graph generation remain unexplored in the literature. Graph generation requires the LLM to generate graphs with given properties, which has valuable real-world applications such as drug discovery, while tends to be more challenging. In this paper, we propose LLM4GraphGen to explore the ability of LLMs for graph generation with systematical task designs and extensive experiments. Specifically, we propose several tasks tailored with comprehensive experiments to address key questions regarding LLMs' understanding of different graph structure rules, their ability to capture structural type distributions, and their utilization of domain knowledge for property-based graph generation. Our evaluations demonstrate that LLMs, particularly GPT-4, exhibit preliminary abilities in graph generation tasks, including rule-based and distribution-based generation. We also observe that popular prompting methods, such as few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting, do not consistently enhance performance. Besides, LLMs show potential in generating molecules with specific properties. These findings may serve as foundations for designing good LLMs based models for graph generation and provide valuable insights and further research.

## Beyond Surface Similarity: Detecting Subtle Semantic Shifts in Financial   Narratives 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * In this paper, we introduce the Financial-STS task, a financial domain-specific NLP task designed to measure the nuanced semantic similarity between pairs of financial narratives. These narratives originate from the financial statements of the same company but correspond to different periods, such as year-over-year comparisons. Measuring the subtle semantic differences between these paired narratives enables market stakeholders to gauge changes over time in the company's financial and operational situations, which is critical for financial decision-making. We find that existing pretrained embedding models and LLM embeddings fall short in discerning these subtle financial narrative shifts. To address this gap, we propose an LLM-augmented pipeline specifically designed for the Financial-STS task. Evaluation on a human-annotated dataset demonstrates that our proposed method outperforms existing methods trained on classic STS tasks and generic LLM embeddings.

## ChainLM: Empowering Large Language Models with Improved Chain-of-Thought   Prompting 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting can enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), establishing itself as a primary approach to solving complex reasoning tasks. Existing CoT synthesis approaches usually focus on simpler reasoning tasks and thus result in low-quality and inconsistent CoT prompts. In response to this challenge, we present an empirical investigation of CoT prompting and introduce CoTGenius, a novel framework designed for the automatic generation of superior CoT prompts. CoTGenius is developed based on three major evolution strategies, i.e., complicate, diversify, and specify-alongside two filtering mechanisms: evolutionary success judgement and correctness verification. We further employ CoTGenius to create an extensive CoT dataset, and subsequently fine-tune the Llama 2-Chat 7B and 13B models on this dataset. We call the resulting model ChainLM. To deal with the cumulative error issue in reasoning steps, we propose a step-level debating method, wherein multiple debaters discuss each reasoning step to arrive at the correct answer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ChainLM models exhibit enhanced proficiency in addressing a spectrum of complex reasoning problems compared to existing models. In addition, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the impact of data categories within CoTGenius on the model performance. We release our dataset and code at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/ChainLM.

## Multi-role Consensus through LLMs Discussions for Vulnerability   Detection 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the potential for vulnerability detection, a crucial component of software quality assurance. Despite this progress, most studies have been limited to the perspective of a single role, usually testers, lacking diverse viewpoints from different roles in a typical software development life-cycle, including both developers and testers. To this end, this paper introduces an approach to employ LLMs to act as different roles to simulate real-life code review process, engaging in discussions towards a consensus on the existence and classification of vulnerabilities in the code. Preliminary evaluation of the proposed approach indicates a 4.73% increase in the precision rate, 58.9% increase in the recall rate, and a 28.1% increase in the F1 score.

## LLM-based Extraction of Contradictions from Patents 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * Already since the 1950s TRIZ shows that patents and the technical contradictions they solve are an important source of inspiration for the development of innovative products. However, TRIZ is a heuristic based on a historic patent analysis and does not make use of the ever-increasing number of latest technological solutions in current patents. Because of the huge number of patents, their length, and, last but not least, their complexity there is a need for modern patent retrieval and patent analysis to go beyond keyword-oriented methods. Recent advances in patent retrieval and analysis mainly focus on dense vectors based on neural AI Transformer language models like Google BERT. They are, for example, used for dense retrieval, question answering or summarization and key concept extraction. A research focus within the methods for patent summarization and key concept extraction are generic inventive concepts respectively TRIZ concepts like problems, solutions, advantage of invention, parameters, and contradictions. Succeeding rule-based approaches, finetuned BERT-like language models for sentence-wise classification represent the state-of-the-art of inventive concept extraction. While they work comparatively well for basic concepts like problems or solutions, contradictions - as a more complex abstraction - remain a challenge for these models. This paper goes one step further, as it presents a method to extract TRIZ contradictions from patent texts based on Prompt Engineering using a generative Large Language Model (LLM), namely OpenAI's GPT-4. Contradiction detection, sentence extraction, contradiction summarization, parameter extraction and assignment to the 39 abstract TRIZ engineering parameters are all performed in a single prompt using the LangChain framework. Our results show that "off-the-shelf" GPT-4 is a serious alternative to existing approaches.

## ERD: A Framework for Improving LLM Reasoning for Cognitive Distortion   Classification 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * Improving the accessibility of psychotherapy with the aid of Large Language Models (LLMs) is garnering a significant attention in recent years. Recognizing cognitive distortions from the interviewee's utterances can be an essential part of psychotherapy, especially for cognitive behavioral therapy. In this paper, we propose ERD, which improves LLM-based cognitive distortion classification performance with the aid of additional modules of (1) extracting the parts related to cognitive distortion, and (2) debating the reasoning steps by multiple agents. Our experimental results on a public dataset show that ERD improves the multi-class F1 score as well as binary specificity score. Regarding the latter score, it turns out that our method is effective in debiasing the baseline method which has high false positive rate, especially when the summary of multi-agent debate is provided to LLMs.

## LayoutLLM: Large Language Model Instruction Tuning for Visually Rich   Document Understanding 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * This paper proposes LayoutLLM, a more flexible document analysis method for understanding imaged documents. Visually Rich Document Understanding tasks, such as document image classification and information extraction, have gained significant attention due to their importance. Existing methods have been developed to enhance document comprehension by incorporating pre-training awareness of images, text, and layout structure. However, these methods require fine-tuning for each task and dataset, and the models are expensive to train and operate. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new LayoutLLM that integrates these with large-scale language models (LLMs). By leveraging the strengths of existing research in document image understanding and LLMs' superior language understanding capabilities, the proposed model, fine-tuned with multimodal instruction datasets, performs an understanding of document images in a single model. Our experiments demonstrate improvement over the baseline model in various document analysis tasks.

## Reinforcement Learning from Reflective Feedback (RLRF): Aligning and   Improving LLMs via Fine-Grained Self-Reflection 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * Despite the promise of RLHF in aligning LLMs with human preferences, it often leads to superficial alignment, prioritizing stylistic changes over improving downstream performance of LLMs. Underspecified preferences could obscure directions to align the models. Lacking exploration restricts identification of desirable outputs to improve the models. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel framework: Reinforcement Learning from Reflective Feedback (RLRF), which leverages fine-grained feedback based on detailed criteria to improve the core capabilities of LLMs. RLRF employs a self-reflection mechanism to systematically explore and refine LLM responses, then fine-tuning the models via a RL algorithm along with promising responses. Our experiments across Just-Eval, Factuality, and Mathematical Reasoning demonstrate the efficacy and transformative potential of RLRF beyond superficial surface-level adjustment.

## PeerGPT: Probing the Roles of LLM-based Peer Agents as Team Moderators   and Participants in Children's Collaborative Learning 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * In children's collaborative learning, effective peer conversations can significantly enhance the quality of children's collaborative interactions. The integration of Large Language Model (LLM) agents into this setting explores their novel role as peers, assessing impacts as team moderators and participants. We invited two groups of participants to engage in a collaborative learning workshop, where they discussed and proposed conceptual solutions to a design problem. The peer conversation transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. We discovered that peer agents, while managing discussions effectively as team moderators, sometimes have their instructions disregarded. As participants, they foster children's creative thinking but may not consistently provide timely feedback. These findings highlight potential design improvements and considerations for peer agents in both roles.

## Improving the Robustness of Large Language Models via Consistency   Alignment 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * Large language models (LLMs) have shown tremendous success in following user instructions and generating helpful responses. Nevertheless, their robustness is still far from optimal, as they may generate significantly inconsistent responses due to minor changes in the verbalized instructions. Recent literature has explored this inconsistency issue, highlighting the importance of continued improvement in the robustness of response generation. However, systematic analysis and solutions are still lacking. In this paper, we quantitatively define the inconsistency problem and propose a two-stage training framework consisting of instruction-augmented supervised fine-tuning and consistency alignment training. The first stage helps a model generalize on following instructions via similar instruction augmentations. In the second stage, we improve the diversity and help the model understand which responses are more aligned with human expectations by differentiating subtle differences in similar responses. The training process is accomplished by self-rewards inferred from the trained model at the first stage without referring to external human preference resources. We conduct extensive experiments on recent publicly available LLMs on instruction-following tasks and demonstrate the effectiveness of our training framework.

## MMIDR: Teaching Large Language Model to Interpret Multimodal   Misinformation via Knowledge Distillation 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * Automatic detection of multimodal misinformation has gained a widespread attention recently. However, the potential of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) for multimodal misinformation detection remains underexplored. Besides, how to teach LLMs to interpret multimodal misinformation in cost-effective and accessible way is still an open question. To address that, we propose MMIDR, a framework designed to teach LLMs in providing fluent and high-quality textual explanations for their decision-making process of multimodal misinformation. To convert multimodal misinformation into an appropriate instruction-following format, we present a data augmentation perspective and pipeline. This pipeline consists of a visual information processing module and an evidence retrieval module. Subsequently, we prompt the proprietary LLMs with processed contents to extract rationales for interpreting the authenticity of multimodal misinformation. Furthermore, we design an efficient knowledge distillation approach to distill the capability of proprietary LLMs in explaining multimodal misinformation into open-source LLMs. To explore several research questions regarding the performance of LLMs in multimodal misinformation detection tasks, we construct an instruction-following multimodal misinformation dataset and conduct comprehensive experiments. The experimental findings reveal that our MMIDR exhibits sufficient detection performance and possesses the capacity to provide compelling rationales to support its assessments.

## Deep Learning for Trajectory Data Management and Mining: A Survey and   Beyond 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * Trajectory computing is a pivotal domain encompassing trajectory data management and mining, garnering widespread attention due to its crucial role in various practical applications such as location services, urban traffic, and public safety. Traditional methods, focusing on simplistic spatio-temporal features, face challenges of complex calculations, limited scalability, and inadequate adaptability to real-world complexities. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the development and recent advances in deep learning for trajectory computing (DL4Traj). We first define trajectory data and provide a brief overview of widely-used deep learning models. Systematically, we explore deep learning applications in trajectory management (pre-processing, storage, analysis, and visualization) and mining (trajectory-related forecasting, trajectory-related recommendation, trajectory classification, travel time estimation, anomaly detection, and mobility generation). Notably, we encapsulate recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) that hold the potential to augment trajectory computing. Additionally, we summarize application scenarios, public datasets, and toolkits. Finally, we outline current challenges in DL4Traj research and propose future directions. Relevant papers and open-source resources have been collated and are continuously updated at: \href{https://github.com/yoshall/Awesome-Trajectory-Computing}{DL4Traj Repo}.

## AI and Memory Wall 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * The availability of unprecedented unsupervised training data, along with neural scaling laws, has resulted in an unprecedented surge in model size and compute requirements for serving/training LLMs. However, the main performance bottleneck is increasingly shifting to memory bandwidth. Over the past 20 years, peak server hardware FLOPS has been scaling at 3.0x/2yrs, outpacing the growth of DRAM and interconnect bandwidth, which have only scaled at 1.6 and 1.4 times every 2 years, respectively. This disparity has made memory, rather than compute, the primary bottleneck in AI applications, particularly in serving. Here, we analyze encoder and decoder Transformer models and show how memory bandwidth can become the dominant bottleneck for decoder models. We argue for a redesign in model architecture, training, and deployment strategies to overcome this memory limitation.

## From Handcrafted Features to LLMs: A Brief Survey for Machine   Translation Quality Estimation 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * Machine Translation Quality Estimation (MTQE) is the task of estimating the quality of machine-translated text in real time without the need for reference translations, which is of great importance for the development of MT. After two decades of evolution, QE has yielded a wealth of results. This article provides a comprehensive overview of QE datasets, annotation methods, shared tasks, methodologies, challenges, and future research directions. It begins with an introduction to the background and significance of QE, followed by an explanation of the concepts and evaluation metrics for word-level QE, sentence-level QE, document-level QE, and explainable QE. The paper categorizes the methods developed throughout the history of QE into those based on handcrafted features, deep learning, and Large Language Models (LLMs), with a further division of deep learning-based methods into classic deep learning and those incorporating pre-trained language models (LMs). Additionally, the article details the advantages and limitations of each method and offers a straightforward comparison of different approaches. Finally, the paper discusses the current challenges in QE research and provides an outlook on future research directions.

## Benchmarking Chinese Commonsense Reasoning of LLMs: From   Chinese-Specifics to Reasoning-Memorization Correlations 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * We introduce CHARM, the first benchmark for comprehensively and in-depth evaluating the commonsense reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) in Chinese, which covers both globally known and Chinese-specific commonsense. We evaluated 7 English and 12 Chinese-oriented LLMs on CHARM, employing 5 representative prompt strategies for improving LLMs' reasoning ability, such as Chain-of-Thought. Our findings indicate that the LLM's language orientation and the task's domain influence the effectiveness of the prompt strategy, which enriches previous research findings. We built closely-interconnected reasoning and memorization tasks, and found that some LLMs struggle with memorizing Chinese commonsense, affecting their reasoning ability, while others show differences in reasoning despite similar memorization performance. We also evaluated the LLMs' memorization-independent reasoning abilities and analyzed the typical errors. Our study precisely identified the LLMs' strengths and weaknesses, providing the clear direction for optimization. It can also serve as a reference for studies in other fields. We will release CHARM at https://github.com/opendatalab/CHARM .

## Can ChatGPT Detect DeepFakes? A Study of Using Multimodal Large Language   Models for Media Forensics 
  * 2024-03-21  
  * DeepFakes, which refer to AI-generated media content, have become an increasing concern due to their use as a means for disinformation. Detecting DeepFakes is currently solved with programmed machine learning algorithms. In this work, we investigate the capabilities of multimodal large language models (LLMs) in DeepFake detection. We conducted qualitative and quantitative experiments to demonstrate multimodal LLMs and show that they can expose AI-generated images through careful experimental design and prompt engineering. This is interesting, considering that LLMs are not inherently tailored for media forensic tasks, and the process does not require programming. We discuss the limitations of multimodal LLMs for these tasks and suggest possible improvements.
